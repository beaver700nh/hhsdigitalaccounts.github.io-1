Never carry a microscope with just one hand.</li>					<li>Gently place the microscope on the table with the arm facing you, about 10 cm from the edge of the table.</li>					<li>If necessary, gently clean the lenses with lens paper. Do not touch the lenses with your hands or with regular tissue paper.</li>					<li>Determine the light source for your microscope. If the microscope has a lamp, plug it in and adjust the light to a comfortable level. If the microscope has a mirror, adjust the mirror to reflect light through the diaphragm. Never use direct sunlight as a light source with a mirror because it can damage your eyes.</li>					<li>Once you have placed a prepared slide on the stage and secured it with the stage clips, watch from the side of the microscope (not through the eyepiece) as you use the coarse adjustment to lower the objective lens toward the slide. Stop the objective lens just above, but not touching, the slide. Touching the slide with the objective lens may damage the lens, the slide, or both.</li>					<li>Always keep both eyes open when viewing a slide. This helps to prevent eye strain.</li>					<li>After every use, remove the slide. Clean the microscope stage and the lenses.</li>					</ol>			</span>			</p>		</td>	</tr></table><table WIDTH="530" border="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="3">						<tr> 							<td width="535" VALIGN="TOP"><br><IMG SRC="../../../shared/images/navigation/bottom_line.gif" alt="_____" WIDTH="530" HEIGHT="2" border="0" ></TD>						</TR>						<tr> 							<td width="535" VALIGN="TOP"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">writeCopyright();</script><br></TD>						</TR>					</table></BODY></HTML>
