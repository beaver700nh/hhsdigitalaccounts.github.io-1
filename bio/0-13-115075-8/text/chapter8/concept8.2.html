			<p>Chloroplasts are like chemical factories inside plant cells. The energy to run these factories comes from the sun, an energy source more than 150 million kilometers from Earth. In this section, you'll follow the chain of events that occurs when sunlight enters a chloroplast</p>

			<p><span class="setextsub">Light Energy and Pigments</span><br>			
Sunlight is a form of electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetic energy travels in waves that can be compared to ocean waves rolling onto a beach. The distance between two adjacent waves is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/w/gwavelen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/w/gwavelen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">wavelength</a>. The different forms of electromagnetic energy have characteristic wavelengths, as shown in Figure 8-5. The range of types of electromagnetic energy, from the very short wavelengths of gamma rays to the very long wavelengths of radio waves, is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gelecmag.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gelecmag.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">electromagnetic spectrum</a>.

			<p>Visible light&#151;those wavelengths that your eyes see as different colors&#151;makes up only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light consists of wavelengths from about 400 nanometers (nm), violet, to about 700 nm, red. Shorter wavelengths have more energy than longer wavelengths. In fact, wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light have enough energy to damage organic molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. This is why being exposed to the ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight can cause sunburns and lead to skin cancer.</p>

			<p><span class="setextsubsm">Pigments and Color</span> A substance's color is due to chemical compounds called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpigment.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpigment.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pigments</a>. When light shines on a material that contains pigments, three things can happen to the different wavelengths: they can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. The pigments in the leaf's chloroplasts absorb blue-violet and red-orange light very well. The chloroplasts convert some of this absorbed light energy into chemical energy. But the chloroplast pigments do not absorb green light well. As shown in Figure 8-6, most of the green light passes through the leaf (is transmitted) or bounces back (is reflected). Leaves look green because the green light is not absorbed.

			<p><span class="setextsubsm">Identifying Chloroplast Pigments</span> Using a laboratory technique called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpaperch.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpaperch.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">paper chromatography</a>, you could observe the different pigments in a green leaf. First you would press the leaf onto a strip of filter paper to deposit a "stain." Next you would seal the paper in a cylinder containing solvents, working under a vented laboratory hood. (In Online Activity 8.2, you can carry out a virtual paper chromatography experiment.)</p>

<p>As the solvents move up the paper strip, the pigments dissolve in the solvents and are carried up the strip. Different pigments travel at different rates, depending on how easily they dissolve and how strongly they are attracted to the paper. Figure 8-7 shows some chromatography results. Notice that several different pigments have separated out on the paper. Chlorophyll <i>a</i>, which absorbs mainly blue-violet and red light and reflects mainly green light, plays a major role in the light reactions of photosynthesis. Chloroplasts also contain other "helper" pigments. These include chlorophyll <i>b</i>, which absorbs mainly blue and orange light and reflects yellow-green; and several types of carotenoids, which absorb mainly blue-green light and reflect yellow-orange.</p>

				<p><span class="setextsub">Harvesting Light Energy</span><br>			
Suppose that you could observe what happens inside a chloroplast as sunlight strikes a leaf. Within the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll and other molecules are arranged in clusters called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphotsys.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphotsys.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">photosystems</a> (Figure 8-8). Each photosystem contains a few hundred pigment molecules, including chlorophyll <i>a</i>, chlorophyll <i>b</i>, and carotenoids. This cluster of pigment molecules acts like a light-gathering panel, somewhat like a miniature version of a solar collector.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

									<td align="center"><img src="08images/08-08.gif" width="525" height="248" ALT="Figure 8-8"><br></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 8-8<br> When light strikes the chloroplast, pigment molecules absorb the energy. This energy jumps from molecule to molecule until it arrives at the reaction center.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
				<p>Each time a pigment molecule absorbs light energy, one of the pigment's electrons gains energy&#151;the electron is raised from a low-energy "ground state" to a high-energy "excited state." This excited state is very unstable. Almost immediately, the excited electron falls back to the ground state and transfers the energy to a neighboring molecule. The energy transfer excites an electron in the receiving molecule. When this electron drops back to the ground state, it excites an electron in the next pigment molecule, and so on. In this way, the energy "jumps" from molecule to molecule until it arrives at what is called the reaction center of the photosystem.</p>

				<p>The reaction center consists of a chlorophyll <i>a</i> molecule located next to another molecule called a primary electron acceptor. The primary electron acceptor is a molecule that traps the excited electron from the chlorophyll <i>a</i> molecule. Other teams of molecules built into the thylakoid membrane can now use that trapped energy to make ATP and NADPH.</p>

				<p><span class="setextsub">Chemical Products of Light Reactions</span><br>			
Two photosystems are involved in the light reactions, as shown in Figure 8-10. The first photosystem traps light energy and transfers the light-excited electrons to an electron transport chain. This photosystem can be thought of as the "water-splitting photosystem" because the electrons are replaced by splitting a molecule of water. This process releases oxygen as a waste product, and also releases hydrogen ions.</p>

				<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="08images/08-10.gif" width="525" height="434" ALT="Figure 8-10"><br></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 8-10<br> The light reactions involve two photosystems connected by an electron transport chain.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
				<p>The electron transport chain connecting the two photosystems releases energy, which the chloroplast uses to make ATP. This mechanism of ATP production is very similar to ATP production in cellular respiration. In both cases, an electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions across a membrane&#151;the inner mitochondrial membrane in respiration and the thylakoid membrane in photosynthesis. The main difference is that in respiration food provides the electrons for the electron transport chain, while in photosynthesis light-excited electrons from chlorophyll travel down the chain.</p> 

<p>The second photosystem can be thought of as the "NADPH-producing photosystem." This photosystem produces NADPH by transferring excited electrons and hydrogen ions to NADP<span class="SUB"><sup>+</sup></span>. Figure 8-11 shows a mechanical analogy for the light reactions. Note how the light energy "bumps up" the electrons to their excited state in each photosystem.</p>

			<p>The light reactions convert light energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH. But recall that photosynthesis also produces sugar. So far no sugar has been produced. That is the job of the Calvin cycle, which uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions.</p>
