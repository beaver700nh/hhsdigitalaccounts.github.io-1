<p>It would be unfortunate for humans and many other living things if photosynthesis stopped after the light reactions. The process so far has released one important final product, oxygen. But as you have read, organisms depend on the sugars and other organic compounds produced by plants as fuel for cellular respiration and as building materials. The Calvin cycle is responsible for producing the raw materials for these compounds.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Trip Around the Calvin Cycle</span><br>
You can think of the Calvin cycle as being somewhat like a sugar factory within a chloroplast. It is called a cycle because, like the Krebs cycle in cellular respiration, the starting material is regenerated each time the process occurs. In this case, the starting material that gets regenerated is a compound called RuBP, a sugar with five carbons.</p>

<p>With each turn of the Calvin cycle, there are chemical inputs and outputs. The inputs are carbon dioxide from the air and the ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions. The Calvin cycle uses carbon from the carbon dioxide, energy from the ATP, and high-energy electrons and hydrogen ions from the NADPH. The cycle's output is an energy-rich sugar molecule. That sugar is not yet glucose, but a smaller sugar named G3P. The plant cell uses G3P as the raw material to make glucose and other organic molecules it needs. You can follow the process of the Calvin cycle in Figure 8-13.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Summary of Photosynthesis</span><br>
Now that you've read about the details of photosynthesis, take a step back and look at the overall process again. Recall that the overall equation for photosynthesis is:</p>

<p align="center">6 CO<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> + 6 H<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>O <img src="../images/arrowrt.gif">  <img src="../images/arrowrt.gif">  <img src="../images/arrowrt.gif"> C<span class="sub"><sub>6</sub></span>H<span class="sub"><sub>12</sub></span>O<span class="sub"><sub>6</sub></span> + 6 O<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span></p>
 
<p>The light reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes, convert light energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH. The light reactions use the reactant water from the equation and release the product oxygen. The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide to sugar (Figure 8-14).</p>

								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 8-14<br>The light reactions and the Calvin cycle together convert light energy to the stored chemical energy of sugar. The plant can use the sugar to build other organic molecules.</span></td>

<p>By converting light energy to chemical energy, photosynthesis is the first step in the flow of energy through an ecosystem. Some of that chemical energy then passes from producers to consumers. Even when people eat meat, you can trace its stored energy back to photosynthesis. For example, the beef in a hamburger came from cattle that ate plants. Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all the food you eat and all the oxygen you breathe.</p>
