<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>16. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the diagram below to answer the questions.<br>
 <b>a.</b> What organelle is depicted?<br>
 <b>b.</b> Name the parts of the organelle labeled <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>.<br>
 <b>c.</b> Describe where in this organelle each of the two stages of photosynthesis occurs.</p>

<p><b>17. Analyzing Data</b> Three students are investigating the effect of light intensity on photosynthesis by the aquatic plant <i>Elodea</i>. They varied the light intensity by placing a lamp at five different distances from the aquarium. The students left the room lights on and the window shades up. Then they measured how much oxygen gas the plant produced per hour at the different lamp distances. Here is their data table.</p>

			<p align="center"><img src="08images/08-cr-17.gif" width="260" height="120" ALT="Rate of Photosynthesis in Elodea"></p>
		
<p><b>a.</b> Use the data to make a graph.<br>
 <b>b.</b> At which lamp distance(s) is photosynthesis occurring at the fastest rate? At which lamp distance(s) is photosynthesis occurring at the slowest rate?<br>
 <b>c.</b> The students designed the experiment to test this hypothesis: the closer the lamp, the faster photosynthesis will occur. Do their results support their hypothesis? Why or why not?<br>
<b>d.</b> Can you suggest a possible reason for the results being the same at 60 and 75 cm? Does this suggest any new questions to investigate? Explain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>17. Making Generalizations</b> How is the structure of a chloroplast suited to its function?</p>

<p><b>18. Relating Cause and Effect</b> Explain why a leaf containing chloroplasts looks green in color.</p>

<p><b>19. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Describe at least two similarities and two differences between photosynthesis and cellular respiration.</p>

<p><b>20. Making Generalizations</b> In terms of energy flow, what is the key result of the light reactions?</p>

<p><b>21. Problem Solving</b> A friend challenges you to grow a houseplant using mainly one color of light&#151;red or green. Which would you choose? Explain your answer.</p>

<p><b>22. Making Generalizations</b> Explain how producers and consumers play a role in cycling carbon within the biosphere.</p>

<p><b>23. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Plants can convert sunlight into sugar.<br>
 <b>b.</b> Plants don't need sunlight to make sugar as long as they have a source of carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 <b>c.</b> The Calvin cycle produces glucose directly.<br></p>

<b>Biology Research Project</b><br>
In many parts of the United States, leaves change colors in the fall. Young children are often very curious about this process. With a partner, research, write, and illustrate a children's story that explains why leaves change color.</p>
