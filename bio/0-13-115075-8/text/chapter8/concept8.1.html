<p>
As you read in Chapter 7, photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other producers convert the energy of sunlight into the energy stored in organic molecules. Just as cellular respiration takes place largely within a cell's mitochondria, photosynthesis also occurs in a specific organelle. 
</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Structure of Chloroplasts</span><br>
The cellular organelle where photosynthesis takes place is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchlopla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchlopla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chloroplast</a>. Chloroplasts contain chemical compounds called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchlorop.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchlorop.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chlorophylls</a> that give these organelles a green color. When you observe a plant, all the green parts you can see contain cells with chloroplasts and can carry out photosynthesis. In most plants, the leaves contain the most chloroplasts and are the major sites of photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Within a leaf, the chloroplasts are concentrated in the cells of the mesophyll, the inner layer of tissue (Figure 8-2). Tiny pores called stomata (singular, <i>stoma</i>) are found on the surface of the leaf. Carbon dioxide enters the leaf and oxygen exits the leaf through the stomata. Veins carry water and nutrients from the plant's roots to the leaves. The veins also deliver organic molecules produced in the leaves to other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>The chloroplast's structure is key to its function. Like a mitochondrion, a chloroplast has an inner and an outer membrane. The inner membrane encloses a thick fluid called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstroma.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstroma.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stroma</a>. Suspended in the stroma are many disk-shaped sacs called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthylako.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthylako.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">thylakoids</a>. Each thylakoid is enclosed by a membrane. The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular, <i>granum</i>). These various structures within the chloroplast organize the complex series of chemical reactions that make up the overall process of photosynthesis. Some of the steps take place in the thylakoid membranes, while others take place in the stroma.<br><br>
 

<p><span class="setextsub">Overview of Photosynthesis</span><br>
You have read that cellular respiration involves the process of electron transfer. The "fall" of electrons from glucose to oxygen releases energy, which is then used to make ATP. The opposite occurs in photosynthesis. Electrons from water are boosted "uphill" by the energy from sunlight. The chloroplast uses these "excited" electrons, along with carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions, to produce sugar molecules. The reaction steps add up to the overall chemical equation for photosynthesis shown in Figure 8-3.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages, each with many steps: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle (Figure 8-4).</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Light Reactions</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glightre.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glightre.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">light reactions</a> convert the energy in sunlight to chemical energy. These reactions depend on molecules built into the membranes of the thylakoids. First, chlorophyll molecules in the membranes capture light energy. Then the chloroplasts use the captured energy to remove electrons from water. This splits the water into oxygen and hydrogen ions. The oxygen is a "waste product" of photosynthesis. It escapes to the atmosphere through the stomata of leaves. What becomes of the water's electrons and hydrogen ions? Chloroplasts use them to make an energy-rich molecule called NADPH. (NADPH is an electron carrier very similar to the NADH you read about in Chapter 7.) The chloroplasts also use the captured light energy to generate ATP. The overall result of the light reactions is the conversion of light energy to chemical energy stored in two compounds: NADPH and ATP.</p>


<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Calvin Cycle</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcalvin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcalvin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Calvin cycle</a> makes sugar from the atoms in carbon dioxide plus the hydrogen ions and the high-energy electrons carried by NADPH. The enzymes for the Calvin cycle are located outside the thylakoids and dissolved in the stroma. The ATP made by the light reactions provides the energy to make sugar.</p>

<p>The Calvin cycle is sometimes referred to as the "light-independent reactions" because, unlike the light reactions, it does not directly require light to begin. However, this doesn't mean that the Calvin cycle can continue running in a plant kept in the dark. The Calvin cycle requires two inputs supplied by the light reactions, ATP and NADPH. You'll explore both the light reactions and the Calvin cycle in more detail in Concept 8.2 and Concept 8.3.</p>
