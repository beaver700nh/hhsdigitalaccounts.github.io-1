<p>The science of biology reaches from the global scale of the entire planet down to the microscopic world of cells and molecules. Some biologists ask questions they can answer only with images of Earth beamed down from satellites in space. Other biologists use the world's most powerful microscopes to explore life in its tiniest dimensions. Biologists divide this enormous range of scales into different levels of organization.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Biosphere</span><br>
Suppose you could approach Earth from space, zooming in for a closer and closer look at life. Imagine exploring New York City's Central Park in this way, with each view taking you about a thousand times closer.</p> 

<p>In the first view, you would begin to see signs of life at the global scale of the <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiosphe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiosphe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biosphere</a>, which consists of all the parts of the planet that are inhabited by living things. The biosphere includes most regions of land; most bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers; and the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers. (See the Skills Appendix to review metric measurements.) Even from space you can see evidence of life&#151;the dark green regions of forests on the continents. Zoom in a thousand times closer, and you can see your selected site, Central Park in the middle of Manhattan.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Ecosystems</span><br>
Zooming in another thousand times closer brings you to an area of woodland around a pond within Central Park. Such a woodland is an example of what biologists call an ecosystem. An <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gecosyst.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gecosyst.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ecosystem</a> is the community of living things in an area, along with the nonliving features of the environment that support the living community. For example, this woodland ecosystem's community includes various types of trees and other plants, squirrels and other animals, and countless microscopic forms of life such as bacteria. The woodland's nonliving features include the sunlight, water, air, and soil upon which the living things depend.</p> 

<p>Earth's ecosystems vary widely. Perhaps you live in a desert ecosystem in the southwestern United States or along a seacoast. Or perhaps you live in an area where prairies were once widespread. A tropical rain forest and even a small pond are other examples of ecosystems. Each of these ecosystems has a different community of living things and different nonliving features. All of Earth's ecosystems combined make up the biosphere.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Organisms</span><br>
Another thousand times closer and you can begin to identify individual living things, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gorganis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gorganis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">organisms</a>. A squirrel living near the pond in Central Park is an organism. So is the oak tree that produces acorns that the squirrel eats. There are many insects living on and around the tree and in the soil.</p> 

<p>Some organisms are too small to see at the scale of the squirrel and oak tree. Microscopic organisms&#151;also called microorganisms&#151;in the soil are decomposing (breaking down) the leaf litter and other wastes on the woodland floor. Interactions among the organisms of a community make each ecosystem a dynamic (constantly changing) place.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Cells</span><br>
A view a thousand times closer may take you inside a leaf such as one from the oak tree. You notice that the leaf consists of cells, which look somewhat like microscopic "rooms." <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcell.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcell.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cells</a> are life's basic units of structure and function. All organisms are made of one or more cells.</p>
 
<p>Microscopes are used to take photographs of microscopic subjects, such as a leaf's interior. Each of the cells is only about 25 &#181;m (micrometers) across. (1 &#181;m = one millionth of a meter.) It would take more than 700 of these cells to reach across a penny. Yet, as small as these cells are, they contain even tinier structures. One such structure visible in some of these leaf cells is the nucleus. The nucleus directs all of the activities throughout the cell. You will read more about cells and their structures and processes in Unit 2.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">DNA and Genes</span><br>
Coming closer once again, you would see inside the nucleus of a single cell. If you were to look at a computer model of a very important chemical within a cell's nucleus, you might see spheres representing atoms, the basic building blocks of all materials both living and nonliving. As you'll read in Chapter 4, atoms can bond together, forming molecules such as <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdeooxyri.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdeoxyri.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">DNA</a>, the chemical responsible for inheritance&#151;the passing on of traits from parent organisms to their offspring. A DNA molecule contains the instructions for a cell to make all the other molecules it needs to function. Along the length of each DNA molecule are units of inherited information called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggene.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggene.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genes</a>.</p>

<p>From such molecular machinery of cells on up to the workings of the whole biosphere, biology explores life at its many levels.</p>
