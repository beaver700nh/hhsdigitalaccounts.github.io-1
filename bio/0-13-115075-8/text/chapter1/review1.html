 <b>d.</b> biology and society<br>
    
<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>8.</b> Explain why cells are considered the most basic unit of life.</p>
  
<p><b>9.</b> What is the main difference between organisms in domain Archaea and domain Eukarya?</p>
  
<p><b>10.</b> Describe how a sports team could be considered a system.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> You read that a mantid's camouflage is an example of adaptation. How does its camouflage also represent the form-fits-function theme?</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Choose two objects that were not discussed in the text and describe how their form fits their function.</p>
  
<p><b>13.</b> Describe the interaction between a plant and its environment. What does the plant obtain from the environment and how does the plant affect its environment?</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Explain why life on Earth requires a continuous supply of energy from the sun.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Explain why plants are called producers.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Describe the process of natural selection.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>17.</b> Organize the terms below into a flowchart. Explain why you placed the term <i>population</i> where you did.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Suggest five questions a biologist might ask about the scene below. In your questions consider the various levels (scales) of life, the diversity of life, and biology themes.</p>

						<p align="center"><img src="01images/01-cr-18.jpg" width="276" height="194" ALT="two chimpanzees using a stick"></p>

<p><b>19. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Study the incomplete diagram below and answer the following questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> Describe the purpose of a diagram such as this one.<br>
<b>b.</b> Create a list of items that you would place in the blank section of this diagram. Include at least eight items on your list.<br>
<b>c.</b> How would you label each section? Explain your answer.<br>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>20. Making Generalizations</b> You have read that an ecosystem is a system, and a system is dependent on the interaction of its parts. What do you think might happen in an ecosystem if it lost all of its plant species?</p>
  
<p><b>21. Evaluating Models</b> Describe how your home could be considered an ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>22. Relating Cause and Effect</b> In this chapter you read that DNA is responsible for the similarities between animal parents and their offspring. You also read that DNA is responsible for variations in organisms of the same population. Explain how both these statements can be true.</p>

<p><b>23. Evaluating the Impact of Research</b> Discuss a few positive ways in which the study of biology has affected you.</p>

<p><b>24. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Many organs working together make up a tissue.<br>
<b>b.</b> Energy is recycled constantly in an ecosystem.<br>
<b>c.</b> DNA is made of genes.<br></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> News media and magazines frequently report stories that are connected to biology. In the next 24 hours, collect two biology-related stories from different sources. Briefly describe how each story relates to one or more of the ten themes you read about in this chapter.</p>
