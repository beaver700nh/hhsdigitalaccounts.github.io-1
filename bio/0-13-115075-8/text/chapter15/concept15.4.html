<p>As the science of biology developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major goal was to name and classify Earth's diverse species. You might think this task would be fairly complete by now&#151;but in fact that is not the case. New discoveries, methods, technology, and molecular evidence have revitalized the field, making it one of today's most exciting areas of biological research.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">What Is Taxonomy?</span><br>
A branch of biology called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtaxonom.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtaxonom.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">taxonomy</a> involves the identification, naming, and classification of species. Assigning scientific names to species is an important part of studying the history of life. Although common names such as monkey, fruit fly, and pine generally work well in everyday language, common names can also cause confusion. Each of the names above actually refers to many different species. And sometimes the same common name can even refer to very different organisms. For example, a tortoise might be called a gopher in Florida, but in Kansas, "gopher" might refer to either a ground squirrel or a pocket gopher. Often, a common name doesn't accurately reflect the organism. Consider the names catfish, crayfish, and silverfish&#151;the first is a fish, the second is a small freshwater lobster, and the third is an insect. Then there's the fact that organisms have different common names in different languages. Yet biologists must be able to communicate with one another about the species they study, no matter what language they speak.</p>

<p>To reduce this confusion in discussing organisms, one goal of taxonomy is to assign a universal scientific name to each known species. But taxonomists also attempt to organize the diversity of life by classifying species into larger groups of related species. This section describes some of their methods.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Linnaean System of Classification</span><br>
The system of classification most widely used in biology dates back to Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707&#150;1778). The system has two main characteristics&#151;a two-part Latin name for each species and a hierarchy, or ordering, of species into broader and broader groups.</p>

<p>Linnaeus's system assigns a two-part name, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbinomia.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbinomia.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">binomial<a> (by NOH mee ul), to each species. The first part of a binomial is the genus (plural, <i>genera</i>) to which the species belongs. The second part of a binomial refers to one species within the genus. The two words together identify a unique species. An example of a binomial is <i>Panthera pardus</i>, the scientific name of the leopard. Notice that the first letter of the genus (<i>Panthera</i>) is capitalized, and that the whole binomial is italicized.</p>

<p>The system also groups species into broader categories, starting with the genus in the binomial (Figure 15-24). Closely related species are grouped into the same genus. For example the leopard, and the African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i>) both belong to the genus <i>Panthera</i>. Taxonomists group similar genera in the same family. Next, similar families are placed into orders, orders into classes, and classes into phyla (singular, <i>phylum</i>). Phyla are grouped into kingdoms. Classifying a species by kingdom, phylum, and so on, is like placing students in a large school system. First a student might be identified by school, then by specific grade, and finally as a unique individual by name.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Classification and Evolution</span><br> 
Darwin viewed Linnaeus's system of classification in the context of evolution. Ever since, biologists have strived to have classification represent the evolutionary relationships among species. Species are classified into groups within groups. A diagram that reflects such hypotheses of evolutionary relationships has a branching pattern called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphyloge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphyloge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phylogenetic tree</a> (Figure 15-25). (The diagram's name comes from the word <i>phylogeny</i>, meaning "evolutionary history.")</p>

<p>Homologous structures are one of the best clues to assess how closely organisms are related. Recall from Chapter 14 that homologous structures&#151;like a whale's flipper and a bat's wing&#151;may look different and function very differently in different species. However, they will have basic underlying similarities if they both evolved from a single structure in a common ancestor. The greater the number of homologous structures two species have, the more closely the species are thought to be related.</p>

<p>There are, however, pitfalls in the search for homologous characteristics. Not all similar structures are inherited from a common ancestor. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gconverg.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gconverg.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Convergent evolution </a> is a process in which unrelated species from similar environments have adaptations that seem very similar. Similar adaptations that result from convergent evolution are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganalogo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganalogo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">analogous structures</a>. For example, the wings of insects and those of birds are analogous, not homologous, flight equipment&#151;they evolved independently. And, they are built from entirely different structures. There is no evidence that insects and birds shared a common winged ancestor.</p>

<p>Though only homologous structures should be used to classify organisms, this guideline is not always simple to apply. Adaptation can hide homologous characteristics, as it does in the wing of a bat and flipper of a whale. At the same time, convergent evolution can produce analogous structures that could be mistaken for homologous ones.</p>

<p>One clue that two complex structures are homologous is if you can match up their many parts. The more structural details two complex structures have in common, the less likely it is they evolved independently. The skulls of chimpanzees and humans, for example, are not single bones. Rather, they are a fusion of many bones. And, the two skulls match almost perfectly, bone for bone. It is highly unlikely that such complex structures that match in such detail could have separate origins. Most likely the bone patterns of these skulls were inherited from a common ancestor.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Molecular Data as a Taxonomic Tool</span><br>
You know from Chapter 14 that the relatedness of species can be measured by comparing their genes and gene products (proteins). The more the sequences match up, the more closely the species are probably related. Researchers are now sequencing the genomes of species at a rapid rate. The data&#151;readily available on the Internet&#151;have sparked a boom in the study of evolutionary history. Such molecular data are independent of the structural data that have traditionally been used for classification.</p>

<p>Such molecular comparisons provide a new way to test hypotheses about evolutionary history. The strongest support for any such hypothesis is when molecular data agree with evidence from other sources, such as anatomy (body structure). For instance, fossil data have indicated that whales are closely related to the group of mammals that includes hippos, cows, deer, and pigs. Molecular data have backed up this hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Closer Look at Phylogenetic Trees</span><br>
Taxonomy began a new era in the 1960s. One advance that led the way occurred when the molecular methods just described became available for comparing species' DNA. At the same time, computer technology provided greater power to analyze information. These innovations coincided with a new ways of building phylogenetic trees as hypotheses about evolutionary relationships.</p>

<p>A key feature of a phylogenetic tree is the pattern of braches. Figure 15-28 shows two simple trees constructed from a series of two-way branch points. A particular branching in the cat family could be represented as the diagram on the left. The tree can be expanded to include additional species, as in the diagram on the right. The "deeper" branch point represents the evolutionary split from a common ancestor of the wolf and cat groups. This phylogenetic tree represents the hypothesis that the wolf and cat groups diverged earlier in their evolution than did leopards and house cats.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Identifying Clades</span> Each evolutionary branch in a phylogenetic tree is called a clade. Clades, like taxonomic levels in classification, can nest within larger clades. Continuing with the above example, the cat group represents a clade within a larger clade that also includes the dog group. Each item in a clade may be an individual species, a genus, a family, or some other taxonomic group. However, every clade consists of an ancestral species and all of its descendants. Look at the phylogenetic tree in Figure 15-29. Species B through H are members of a clade (yellow). So are species I through K (orange). But these two groups only become part of a larger clade (blue) when you include species A. Species A is an ancestral species to all of the others in this larger clade. (See if you can identify all five clades in the figure.)</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 15-29<br>Each shaded area in the phylogenetic tree highlights one clade, such as the yellow area including species B through H.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Cladistics</span> How can a biologist determine the sequence of branching in a phylogenetic tree? The most common method today is called cladistics (from the word <i>clade</i>, meaning branch). The key rule in cladistics is that all of the organisms of a particular clade must share homologous structures that do not occur outside the clade. These unique features that unite the organisms as a clade are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gderived.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gderived.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">derived characters</a>.</p>

<p>A phylogenetic diagram that specifies the derived characters of clades is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcladogr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcladogr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cladogram</a>. For example, compare the animals in the cladogram in Figure 15-30. The horse, wolf, leopard, and house cat all have hair. This derived character unites a clade that doesn't include the turtle. (The turtle would be included in a broader clade of animals with backbones.) Teeth adapted for eating meat is a derived character that unites the wolf, the leopard, and the house cat in a clade that excludes the plant-eating horse. Similarly, the ability to retract their claws unites the leopard and the house cat into a smaller clade that doesn't include the wolf.</p>

All the species shown here share a common ancestor that had a backbone. (Each clade is actually defined by several derived characters, not just one.)</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Reexamining Traditional Classification</span> In most cases, cladistic analysis has supported traditional classification. However, basing phylogenetic trees strictly on derived characters produces some surprises. For instance, biologists have traditionally placed birds and reptiles (such as lizards, snakes, and crocodiles) in separate classes of vertebrates. Yet cladistic analysis now suggests that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards and snakes. The cladogram in Figure 15-31 shows birds and crocodiles in one clade, and lizards and snakes in another. Now look at the larger clade that includes the ancestor that crocodiles share with lizards and snakes. In this scheme, the reptile group must also include birds. This classification seems to go against common sense and tradition. For many people, the unique flight adaptations of birds justify separating them from the crocodiles and other reptiles. Keeping birds in a separate group from reptiles may be more comfortable, but it probably does not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Comparing Classification Schemes</span><br>
Phylogenetic trees and classifications represent hypotheses about evolutionary history. Like all hypotheses, they are revised to correspond with the discovery of new evidence. In some cases they are even rejected. Cladistic analysis of molecular data is changing scientists' understanding of certain evolutionary relationships. The changes even affect classification at the kingdom level.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Two- and Three-Kingdom Schemes</span> Biologists have traditionally considered the kingdom to be the broadest taxonomic category. Each of the authors of this text first learned a different scheme for kingdom classification. In high school, the oldest author learned that there are only two kingdoms of life&#151;plants and animals. The two-kingdom system had a long tradition in taxonomy. Linnaeus divided all known forms of life between the plant and animal kingdoms. (None of the authors is as old as Linnaeus!) The two-kingdom system prevailed for over 200 years, but it had its problems. Where do prokaryotes fit in such a system? Can they be considered members of the plant kingdom? And what about fungi? Another author of this text learned a three-kingdom model in high school biology. This model placed protists such as protozoans into their own kingdom. But this model also failed to fit new evidence about the biology and evolutionary history of certain forms of life.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">A Five-Kingdom Scheme</span> In 1969, American ecologist Robert H. Whittaker proposed a five-kingdom system. This is the system that the youngest author first learned. It places prokaryotes such as bacteria in the kingdom Monera. Organisms of the other four kingdoms all consist of eukaryotic cells (see Chapter 6). The kingdoms for plants, fungi, and animals consist of multicellular eukaryotes. Among eukaryotes, these kingdoms differ in structure, development, and modes of nutrition. Plants make their own food by photosynthesis. Fungi live by decomposing the remains of other organisms and absorbing small organic molecules. Most animals live by ingesting food and digesting it within their bodies.

<p>In the five-kingdom system, the kingdom Protista contains all eukaryotes that do not fit the definitions of plant, fungus, or animal. Most protists are unicellular. Amoebas and other so-called protozoa are examples. But protists also include certain large, multicellular organisms that are thought to be close relatives of unicellular protists.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Three Domains</span> In the last decade, molecular data and cladistics have led to a reevaluation of the five-kingdom system. Figure 15-32 shows a three-domain system as one alternative to the five-kingdom system. A domain is a taxonomic category above the kingdom level. This newer scheme recognizes three basic groups: two domains of prokaryotes&#151;the Bacteria and the Archaea&#151;and one domain of eukaryotes, the Eukarya. The Bacteria and the Archaea differ in a number of ways, as you'll read in Chapter 16. What is most important to understand here is that classifying Earth's diverse species of life is a work in progress. As more is learned about organisms and their evolution, classification schemes will continue to be revised. It is quite possible that if you continue your study of biology in the coming years, you may learn about new and different taxonomic systems.</p>
