<p>So far, you've been reading about examples in which one species gives rise to another similar species. Yet most people think of evolution as involving more dramatic transformations, such as new body forms or the intricate structure of an eye. Can Darwin's theory of gradual change account for such "breakthroughs" in form and function?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Refinement of Existing Adaptations</span><br>
Any living organism has a number of adaptations. Examples might include the fins and flippers of swimming animals, bodies adapted for flight, or the structure of an eye or a flower. How does natural selection account for these adaptations? In some cases, a complex structure may have evolved from a simpler structure having the same basic function&#151;a process of refinement. For example, the camera-like eye of a mammal is an amazing structure with many interacting parts. Some people cannot consider that such complex organs could evolve by gradual refinement of simpler structures. If the eye needs all of its parts to work, the argument goes, how could a partial eye be of any use as an evolutionary stage? What's the use of a retina (a layer of cells on which light is focused), for instance, without a lens that focuses light? Yet, evidence shows that eyes don't have to be complicated to be useful adaptations.</p>

<p>Among living mollusks (animals that include squids, octopuses, snails, and clams), you can find eyes ranging in complexity from clusters of light-sensitive cells to camera-like eyes with lenses (Figure 15-11). Some mollusks have very simple eyes. Other mollusks have structures called eyecups that have no lenses or other means of focusing images. However, all these animals can at least distinguish light from dark. Considering the long survival of many species with simple eyes, simple eyes are obviously enough to meet these animals' needs. In those animals that do have complex eyes, the organs did not have to evolve from simpler ones in one giant evolutionary jump. Instead, complex eyes probably evolved by small steps of adaptation, refining organs that worked and benefited their owners at each stage. Evidence of these small steps can be seen in other mollusk eyes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Adaptation of Existing Structures to New Functions</span><br>
When World War I ended in 1918, an American paper products company was stuck with a surplus of 375 tons of material for bandage dressings. The company found new functions for the material. For example, they used the paper sheets to make the first facial tissues&#151;the "ancestor" of the products you rely on when you have a cold.</p>

<p>In the history of life there are also instances of existing materials or structures that evolved as adaptations for certain functions and later fulfilled different functions. An example is the material called chitin (KY tun). Chitin forms the exoskeleton (shell) of arthropods, which are animals such as insects, spiders, scorpions, and lobsters. In the ocean, where arthropods originated, the exoskeleton helped to protect the animals from predators. More than a hundred million years later, when the arthropod ancestors of insects, spiders, and scorpions began to colonize land, the exoskeleton became adapted to an additional function. Land-dwelling organisms face the severe environmental challenge of dehydration&#151;the loss of body water by evaporation. The chitin of the arthropod exoskeleton resists water loss. Chemical changes to this material made it even more water-tight as the animals became adapted to living on land.</p> 

<p>The flippers of penguins are another example of how natural selection can modify existing structures for different functions. Penguins are birds. The flippers they use to swim are actually modified wings. Penguins inhabit small, barren islands and other remote locations in the Southern Hemisphere where flight would offer little advantage for either escape or hunting. Large predators are rare on these rocky or icy islands. Also, food is far more abundant in the surrounding sea than on the land or ice. Though penguins cannot fly through the air, they are strong, fast underwater swimmers. They can dive into the sea to hunt small fish and other prey. Natural selection has remodeled the wings into powerful flippers for swimming.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Evolution and Development</span><br>
What is the genetic basis for the evolutionary remodeling of body form? Some answers to this question are coming from the field of developmental biology, including embryology. <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gembryol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gembryol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Embryology</a> is the study of the processes of multicellular organisms as they develop from fertilized eggs to fully formed organisms. One important focus of embryology are genes that control the development of an organism as it begins to take shape. For example, the homeotic genes you learned about in Chapter 13 program the placement of body parts, such as the locations of wings, legs, and antennae in insects. A mutation in such a master control gene can produce bizarre effects, such as a fly with legs developing where antennae would normally be located. Less dramatic, but more important in evolution, are more subtle changes in the developmental programs of organisms.</p>

<p>In some cases, the remodeling process of evolution involves changes in the rate or timing of some event in the development of an organism. An example is the evolutionary adaptation of feet in various salamander species. (Salamanders are vertebrates closely related to frogs.) Most salamanders live on the ground or in the water, but some species live in trees. The feet of these tree-dwelling salamanders are adapted for climbing. They have shorter toes and more webbing than the feet of salamanders that live on the ground (Figure 15-15). The difference occurs because growth of the feet of the tree-dwellers ends sooner in development, even as the rest of the body continues to grow. As scientists investigate genetic programs that control development, they hope to learn more about the remodeling mechanisms of evolution.</p>
