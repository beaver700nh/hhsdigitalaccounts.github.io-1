<p>For centuries, plant and animal breeders had many questions about the inheritance of flower colors, fur length, and other characters of organisms. Observations alone could not answer all these questions. Then an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel devised a series of experiments that revealed the basic rules underlying patterns of inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Blending Hypothesis of Inheritance</span><br>
A <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtrait.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtrait.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">trait</a> is a variation of a particular character. For example, one plant might have the trait of red flowers, while another might have the trait of yellow flowers. In the early 1800s, biologists proposed the <i>blending hypothesis</i> to explain how offspring inherit traits from both parents. For example, suppose a red-flowered plant were crossed with a yellow-flowered plant of the same species. According to the blending hypothesis, the red and yellow hereditary material in the offspring would blend, producing orange-flowered plants&#151;like blending red and yellow paint to make orange paint. Based on this hypothesis, all offspring of orange-flowered plants would also have orange flowers.</p>

<p>But people observed many exceptions to blending. For example, red-flowered parents sometimes produced yellow-flowered offspring. The blending hypothesis was eventually discarded because it could not explain how traits that disappear in one generation can reappear in later ones.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Mendel's Plant Breeding Experiments</span><br>
In the nineteenth century, most biologists worked by observing and describing nature. Gregor Mendel was one of the first to apply an experimental approach to the question of inheritance. His work eventually gave rise to <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenetis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenetis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genetics</a>, the study of heredity.</p>

<p>For seven years, Mendel bred pea plants and recorded inheritance patterns in the offspring. Based on his results, he developed a <i>particulate hypothesis</i> of inheritance. This hypothesis states that parents pass on to their offspring separate and distinct factors (today called genes) that are responsible for inherited traits. Mendel stressed that these heritable factors retain their identity generation after generation. In other words, genes are more like marbles of different colors than paints. Just as marbles retain their individual colors, genes retain their own identities. </p>

<p>Mendel's first step was to identify pea plants that were true-breeding. When self-fertilized, a true-breeding plant produces offspring identical in appearance to itself generation after generation. For instance, Mendel identified a purple-flowered pea plant that, when self-fertilized, always produced offpring plants that had purple flowers. To ensure self-fertilization, Mendel tied a little cloth bag around the flowers so that pollen from other plants could not enter.</p>

<p>To test the particulate hypothesis, Mendel crossed true-breeding plants that had two distinct and contrasting traits&#151;for example, purple or white flowers. These contrasting pea varieties served as parents for the next generation. In a method called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcrossfe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcrossfe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cross-fertilization</a>, or cross, sperm from the pollen of one flower fertilizes the eggs in the flower of a different plant (Figure 10-2). The fertilized eggs developed into embryos within seeds (peas) that Mendel planted. The seeds grew into offspring that eventually produced their own flowers. Mendel apparently wondered, if a purple-flowered pea plant were fertilized with pollen from a white-flowered plant, what color flowers would the offspring have? You'll read about his results in Concept 10.2.</p>
