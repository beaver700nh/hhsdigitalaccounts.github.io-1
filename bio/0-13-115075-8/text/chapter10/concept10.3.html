<p>For his experiments Mendel carefully selected simple pea plant characters to study. His choice increased the chance that he might be able to determine the basic rules behind inheritance patterns. However, many characters of organisms have more complicated inheritance patterns than those studied by Mendel. In this section, you will explore the reasons for these patterns.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Intermediate Inheritance</span><br>
The F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> offspring of Mendel's pea crosses always looked like the dominant homozygous parent. This is because one dominant allele was enough to produce the dominant phenotype, but the recessive phenotype required inheriting two recessive alleles. But for some characters of organisms, neither allele is dominant. The heterozygotes have a phenotype that is intermediate between the phenotypes of the <i>two</i> homozygotes. This pattern of inheritance is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginterme.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginterme.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">intermediate inheritance</a>. For example, in a particular breed of chicken called Andalusians, black and white parents produce F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> hybrid offspring, called "blues," with grayish-blue feathers (Figure 10-9). Because neither the black nor white allele is dominant, capital and lowercase letters are not used to represent them. Instead, a <i>C</i> for "color" is paired with a superscript <i>B</i> for "black" or <i>W</i> for "white" to represent the two alleles. A heterozygote chicken has one of each allele, <i>C<span class="sub"><sup>B</sup></span>C<span class="sub"><sup>W</sup></span></i>, and is blue in color.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>Although the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> phenotypes are intermediate, this inheritance pattern does not support the blending hypothesis. This is because the parent phenotypes can reappear in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation. In the chicken example, the predicted phenotypes in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> are 1 black : 2 blue : 1 white. Note that 1 : 2 : 1 is also the ratio of genotypes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Multiple Alleles</span><br>
The inheritance patterns you have explored so far have involved only two contrasting alleles for each inherited character. But for many genes several alleles exist in the population. This expands the number of possible genotypes and phenotypes.</p>

<p>For example, multiple alleles control the character of blood type in humans. A person's blood type may be A, B, AB, or O. The letters refer to two carbohydrates, designated A and B, which are found on the surface of red blood cells. A person's red blood cells may be coated with one carbohydrate (type A) or the other (type B), with both (type AB), or with neither (type O).</p>

<p>Figure 10-10 shows how these four blood types result from various combinations of three alleles, symbolized as <i>I<span class="sub"><sup>A</sup></span></i> (for carbohydrate A), <i>I<span class="sub"><sup>B</sup></span></i> (for carbohydrate B), and <i>i</i> (for neither A nor B). Each person inherits one of these alleles from each parent. There are six possible ways to pair the alleles&#151;in other words, there are six possible genotypes. The alleles <i>I<span class="sub"><sup>A</sup></span></i> and <i>I<span class="sub"><sup>B</sup></span></i> exhibit <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcodomin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcodomin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">codominance</a>, meaning that a heterozygote expresses both traits. Note that this is different from intermediate inheritance. The individual's phenotype is not intermediate, but rather shows the separate traits of both alleles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Polygenic Inheritance</span><br>
Each of the seven characters Mendel studied occurred in two distinct phenotypes. For example, flower color was either white or purple. For some characters, intermediate inheritance, codominance of alleles, or multiple types of alleles can lead to more than two phenotypes in a population. When multiple <i>genes</i> affect a character, the variation in phenotypes can become even greater. When two or more genes affect a single character, it is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolygen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolygen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">polygenic inheritance</a> (pahl uh JEN ik). In humans, height and skin color have polygenic inheritance. For example, the height of students in a large high school might range from about 125 cm to 200 cm, with students of every possible height in between. </p>

<p>Consider how three hypothetical genes could produce the variation of height observed in humans. Assume that the three genes are inherited separately, like Mendel's pea genes. Suppose there are three "tall" alleles for each gene (<i>A,</i> <i>B,</i> and <i>C</i>), each of which contributes one "unit" of tallness to the phenotype. These tall alleles exhibit intermediate inheritance with three "short" alleles (<i>X,</i> <i>Y,</i> and <i>Z</i>). A person with genotype <i>AABBCC</i> would be very tall, a person with genotype <i>AXBBCC</i> would be slightly less tall, and so on. The potential combinations of alleles (and thus range of phenotypes) for a character increases with the number of genes that affect that character. Some characters are affected by dozens of genes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Importance of Environment</span><br>
An individual's phenotype depends on environment as well as on genes. For example, although a tree's genotype does not change throughout its lifetime, the tree's leaves vary in size, shape, and greenness from year to year depending on exposure to wind and sunlight.</p>

<p>Temperature has a very interesting effect on the phenotype of certain organisms. For example, a Siamese cat is covered with creamy white fur, except on its ears, face, feet, and tail. The enzyme responsible for black fur color is only active at the cooler temperatures found at the cat's extremities, giving the cat a unique appearance.</p>


<p>In humans, nutrition influences height, exercise affects build, and exposure to sunlight darkens the skin. Even identical twins, who have the same genotype for every character, accumulate some differences in phenotype as a result of their exposure to environmental differences. For example, each twin may have a different diet, activity level, history of illnesses, and exposure to sunlight. </p>

<p>Whether genes or the environment have more of an influence on human characters is a very old and hotly contested topic of debate. There <i>are</i> cases where genes determine phenotype with little or no influence from the environment. Human blood type is an example. More common, however, are characters such as a person's blood count (numbers of red and white blood cells), which is very sensitive to environment as well as genotype. Blood count depends on such factors as the altitude of one's home, a person's customary level of physical activity, and the presence of infection.</p>

<p>In summary, the product of a genotype is generally not a single, rigidly defined phenotype, but a range of possibilities influenced by the environment.</p>
