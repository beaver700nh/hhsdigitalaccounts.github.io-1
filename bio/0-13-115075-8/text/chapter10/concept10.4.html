<p>Mendel's discoveries were not widely known or accepted in his lifetime. During the years from 1866 when Mendel published his work on pea plants to 1900 when Mendel's work was "rediscovered," biologists began to study chromosomes. New evidence about the role of chromosomes in cell reproduction helped biologists to understand Mendel's principles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Chromosome Theory of Inheritance</span><br>
Cell biologists worked out the processes of mitosis and meiosis in the late 1800s. (See Chapter 9 to review these processes.) Then, around 1900, researchers noticed parallels between the behavior of chromosomes and the behavior of Mendel's heritable factors ("genes"). One of biology's most important theories&#151;the chromosome theory of inheritance&#151;emerged.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchrothe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchrothe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chromosome theory of inheritance</a> states that genes are located on chromosomes, and the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization accounts for inheritance patterns. Indeed, it is chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment during meiosis and thus account for Mendel's two principles of the same name.</p>

<p>Recall that every diploid individual, such as a pea plant or a human, has two sets of homologous chromosomes. One set comes from the organism's female parent, and the other set comes from the male parent. In Figures 10-13 and 10-14, chromosomes from one parent are shown in blue, and from the other parent in red. The alleles of a gene reside at the same location, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneloc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneloc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gene locus</a> (plural, <i>loci</i>), on homologous chromosomes (Figure 10-13). Notice that the homologous chromosomes may bear either the same alleles or different ones at a particular locus, making the organism either homozygous or heterozygous for each gene.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Genetic Linkage and Crossing Over</span><br>
When genes are located on separate chromosomes, they sort independently of each other during meiosis.  But what happens when genes are located on the <i>same</i> chromosome? The alleles for these genes would not tend to be sorted into gametes independently since they would stay together during meiosis. The only way such alleles can sort independently is if crossing over during meiosis separates them.</p>

<p>The tendency for the alleles on one chromosome to be inherited together is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenelin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenelin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genetic linkage</a>. The closer two genes are on a chromosome, the greater the genetic linkage (Figure 10-14). The farther apart the genes are, the more likely it is that a crossover event will separate them. For example in Scenario 2 of Figure 10-14, allele <i>B</i> can be found with either allele <i>L</i> or <i>l.</i> Looking at the proportion of gametes with recombined alleles allows scientists to map the distance between genes on a chromosome.</p>

<span class="setextsub">Concept Check 10.4</span><br>
		<b>1.</b> Draw a picture of the possible arrangements of chromosomes in the gametes produced by a pea plant with genotype <i>RRYy</i>. Label the gene loci. (Remember that these genes are located on separate chromosomes.)<br>
		<b>2.</b> Explain how the distance between two gene loci on the same chromosome affects genetic linkage.<br>
