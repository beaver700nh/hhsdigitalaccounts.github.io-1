</p>

<p>Mendel performed many experiments in which he tracked the inheritance of characters in pea plants, such as flower color and seed shape (pea shape). The results led him to formulate several hypotheses about inheritance. Take a look at some of his experiments and follow the reasoning that led to his hypotheses.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Mendel's Principle of Segregation</span><br>
In the language of genetics, the offspring of two different true-breeding varieties are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghybrid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghybrid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hybrids</a>. The parental plants are called the P generation (P for parental), and the hybrid offspring are the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> generation (F for filial, from the Latin word for "son"). When the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants self-fertilize or fertilize each other, their offspring are the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation.</p>

<p>In one experiment, Mendel crossed purple-flowered pea plants with white-flowered pea plants (Figure 10-3). This is an example of a <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmonohyb.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmonohyb.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">monohybrid cross</a>, a pairing in which the parent plants differ in only one (mono) character. Mendel saw that the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> hybrid plants were not a blend of purple and white. The F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> hybrids all had purple flowers, the same color as the purple-flowered parent. Was the factor for white flowers now lost as a result of the crossing? By allowing the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants to self-fertilize, Mendel found the answer to be no. About one fourth of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> plants had white flowers. Mendel concluded that the factor for white flowers did not disappear in the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants. Instead, only the purple flower factor was affecting F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> flower color. He reasoned that the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants must have carried two factors for the flower color character, one for purple and one for white. Today, Mendel's "factors" are called genes.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>In addition to studying the inheritance patterns of flower color, Mendel used monohybrid crosses to investigate six other pea plant characters (Figure 10-4). Each cross produced the same pattern. One of the two parent traits disappeared in the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> generation, but then reappeared in about one fourth of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> offspring. From these results, Mendel developed four hypotheses. Using modern terms (such as <i>gene</i> instead of <i>factor</i>), these hypotheses are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are alternative forms of genes. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants exists in one form for purple and in another form for white. These alternative forms of genes are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gallele.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gallele.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">alleles</a> (uh LEELZ).<br><br></li>
<li>For each inherited character, an organism has two alleles for the gene controlling that character, one from each parent. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghomozyg.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghomozyg.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">homozygous</a> (hoh moh ZY gus) for that character. If the two alleles are different, the individual is <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/gheteroz.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/gheteroz.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">heterozygous</a> (het ur oh ZY gus). <br><br></li>

<li>When only one of the two different alleles in a heterozygous individual appears to affect the trait, that allele is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdominan.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdominan.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dominant</a> allele. And in such cases, the other allele that does not appear to affect the trait is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grecessi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grecessi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">recessive</a> allele. In this book, a capital letter is used to represent the name of a dominant allele (in the flower color example, <i>P</i>). The lowercase version of the same letter is used to represent the recessive allele (<i>p</i>).<br><br></li>

<li>The two alleles for a character segregate (separate) during the formation of gametes (sex cells), so that each gamete carries only one allele for each character. This is known as Mendel's <i>principle of segregation.</i> The union of gametes during fertilization reforms allele pairs in the offspring.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="setextsub">Probability and Punnett Squares</span><br>
In a monohybrid cross of true-breeding (homozygous) purple-flowered and white-flowered plants, Mendel's hypotheses predict that each F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plant will get the dominant purple-flower allele (<i>P</i>) from one parent and the recessive white-flower allele (<i>p</i>) from the other parent. Each F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plant will be heterozygous: <i>Pp.</i> Then the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants grow up and make gametes of their own. Each gamete receives only one allele for flower color, <i>P</i> or <i>p,</i> with equal likelihood.</p>

<p>As the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants fertilize each other, gametes combine randomly and form zygotes with pairs of alleles. The likelihood of each specific pair forming is key to the inheritance pattern seen in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation. Consider the analogy of being handed two pennies (Figure 10-5, left). As you look at the two pennies, you will see <i>2 heads</i> or <i>1 head and 1 tail</i> or <i>2 tails</i>. (Note that there are <i>two</i> different ways to get the outcome of 1 head and 1 tail.) The side shown by one coin is unaffected by the side shown by the other coin. But what is the probability of a particular combination occurring? For example, what is the probability that you will see 2 heads? You can build a table that shows the probability of each combination. List the probabilities for the first coin along the top of a piece of paper, and the probabilities for the second coin along the edge of the paper. Create a grid as shown in Figure 10-5. The probability of a particular combination is the product of the separate probabilities for each coin. For example, the probability of 2 heads showing is 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. </p>

						</table></p>

<p>In the same way, you can calculate the probabilities for different combinations of alleles resulting from a genetic cross. The gametes of the purple F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> flowers pair randomly, making the allele combinations in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation <i>PP</i> or <i>Pp</i> or <i>pp</i> (Figure 10-5, right). (Again, note that there are two ways to get the heterozygous&#151;<i>Pp</i>&#151;outcome.) This type of diagram that shows all possible outcomes of a genetic cross is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpunnett.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpunnett.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Punnett square</a>. You can use a Punnett square to predict probabilities of particular outcomes if you know the genetic makeup of both parents.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Genotype and Phenotype</span><br>
Now that you know how to predict the genetic makeup of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> plants, what can you say about their appearance? In the prediction based on the Punnett square, one fourth of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> plants are homozygous for the purple allele&#151;they have two alleles specifying purple flowers (<i>PP</i>). Clearly, these plants will have purple flowers. One half (1/4 + 1/4) of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> offspring are heterozygous&#151;they have both types of allele (<i>Pp</i>). Like the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants, these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait. Finally, one fourth of the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> plants are homozygous for the white-flower allele (<i>pp</i>). They will display the recessive trait, white flowers. Thus, Mendel's hypotheses account for the 3/4 : 1/4 or 3 : 1 ratio of flower color that he observed in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation.</p>

<p>An observable trait (such as purple flowers) is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphenoty.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphenoty.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phenotype</a> (FEE noh type). The genetic makeup, or combination of alleles (such as <i>PP</i>), is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenotyp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenotyp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genotype</a> (JEE noh type). For the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> plants, the ratio of plants with purple flowers to those with white flowers (3 purple : 1 white) is called the phenotypic ratio. The genotypic ratio is 1 <i>PP</i> : 2 <i>Pp</i> : 1 <i>pp.</i></p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Testcross</span><br>
What is the genotype of an organism that displays the dominant phenotype? Suppose, for example, that you have a purple-flowered pea plant. Its genotype could be either of two possibilities: <i>PP</i> or <i>Pp</i>. To determine whether the purple-flowered plant is homozygous (<i>PP</i>) or heterozygous (<i>Pp</i>), you need to perform what geneticists call a <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtestcro.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtestcro.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">testcross</a>. A testcross breeds an individual of unknown genotype, but dominant phenotype (your purple-flowered mystery plant) with a homozygous recessive individual&#151;in this case, a white-flowered plant (<i>pp</i>).</p>

<p>The appearance of the offspring resulting from the testcross will reveal the genotype of the mystery plant. Because the homozygous recessive parent can only contribute a recessive allele to the offspring, the phenotype will indicate the allele contributed by the mystery plant. If the purple-flowered parent is homozygous, you would expect all of the offspring to be purple-flowered since the mystery plant can only contribute a <i>P</i> allele. Thus, all offspring would be <i>Pp</i> (Figure 10-6, left). However, if the purple-flowered parent is heterozygous, you would expect both purple-flowered (<i>Pp</i>) and white-flowered (<i>pp</i>) offspring (Figure 10-6, right). Figure 10-6 also shows that the white-flowered and purple-flowered offspring of a <i>Pp</i> X <i>pp</i> testcross are predicted to have a 1 : 1 (1 purple to 1 white) ratio of phenotypes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Mendel's Principle of Independent Assortment</span><br>
Two of the seven characters Mendel studied were qualities of the peas themselves: shape and color (see Figure 10-4). From his monohybrid crosses, Mendel knew that round pea shape was dominant to wrinkled shape, and yellow color was dominant to green. What would be the result of a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdihybri.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdihybri.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dihybrid cross</a>&#151;crossing organisms differing in two characters? Figure 10-7 outlines Mendel's results. Mendel crossed a true-breeding plant grown from a round yellow seed (genotype <i>RRYY</i>) with a true-breeding plant grown from a wrinkled green seed (genotype <i>rryy</i>). The first parent could only produce <i>RY</i> gametes. The other could only produce <i>ry</i> gametes. The union of these <i>RY</i> and <i>ry</i> gametes yielded hybrid peas heterozygous for both characters (<i>RrYy</i>). All peas had the dominant phenotype: They were round and yellow.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="410" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The hybrid peas grew into F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> plants, which Mendel allowed to self-fertilize. This produced four phenotypes of peas. Assuming there are four equally likely combinations of alleles in the gametes produced by the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> generation&#151;<i>RY,</i> <i>rY,</i> <i>Ry,</i> and <i>ry</i>&#151;a Punnett square predicts a phenotypic ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 (Figure 10-8). And in fact, Mendel counted 315 round yellow, 108 round green, 101 wrinkled yellow, and 32 wrinkled green peas, a ratio that is approximately 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.</p>

<p align="center"><table width="450" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The Punnett square in Figure 10-8 also reveals that a dihybrid cross has the same outcome as two monohybrid crosses occurring at the same time. If you just look at seed shape, there are 12 plants with round seeds to every 4 with wrinkled seeds. If you look at just seed color, there are 12 yellow-seeded plants to every 4 green-seeded ones. A 12 : 4 ratio is the same as a 3 : 1 ratio, the phenotypic ratio for the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation of a monohybrid cross. </p>

<p>Mendel tested his seven pea characters in various dihybrid combinations. The ratio of phenotypes in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation was always very close to the predicted ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Based on these results Mendel proposed his principle of independent assortment. This principle states that during gamete formation in an F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> cross, a particular allele for one character can be paired with either allele of another character. For instance, in the above example, <i>R</i> can end up with either <i>Y</i> or <i>y,</i> and <i>r</i> can end up with either <i>Y</i> or <i>y.</i> The alleles for different genes are sorted into the gametes independently of one another.</p>

<p>Mendel's principle of independent assortment accurately described the seven pea plant characters he studied. But you will learn later in this chapter that there are certain exceptions to this principle.</p>
