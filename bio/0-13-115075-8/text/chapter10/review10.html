<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>8.</b> Describe the <i>blending hypothesis.</i> Explain why it was discarded as a valid hypothesis.</p>
  
<p><b>9.</b> Suppose you have two fully grown pea plants, one tall and one dwarf. Dwarf height is a recessive trait. Using <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> as the alleles, what is the the dwarf plant's genotype? How could you learn the tall plant's genotype?</p>

<p><b>10.</b> List the possible combinations of alleles in the gametes of an individual with genotype <i>AaBb</i>.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Explain Mendel's <i>principle of independent assortment.</i> When might this principle not apply? </p>

<p><b>12.</b> If a father's blood type is B and a mother's blood type is A, is it possible that their child could have blood type O? Explain your response.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Define polygenic inheritance and give an example of a character that is polygenic.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Explain how a white-eyed male fruit fly can have a red-eyed father.</p>


<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>15.</b> The Punnett square below represents the self-fertilization of a pea plant that is heterozygous for yellow peas. Copy the diagram and fill in the missing alleles to predict the resulting offspring.<br>
<b>a.</b> What fraction of the offspring are predicted to have yellow peas? Green peas?<br>
<b>b.</b> What is the predicted phenotypic ratio of the offspring? The predicted genotypic ratio?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="10images/10-cr-15.gif" width="160" height="149" alt="Punnett square of a pea plant heterozygous for yellow peas"></p>

<p><b>16.</b> Draw a Punnett square to show how the 1 : 2 : 1 ratio of black : blue : white chickens is predicted for the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> offspring shown in Figure 10-9. </p>
		
<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>17. Analyzing Data</b> The table below shows the results of a cross of two red-eyed fruit flies. Some of the offspring have "ruby"-colored (deep pink) eyes instead of the usual red-colored eyes.<br>
<b>a.</b> Are ruby-colored eyes dominant or recessive?<br>
<b>b.</b> How do the results of the cross indicate that ruby eye color is sex-linked?<br>
<b>c.</b> Using <i>X<span class="sub"><sup>R</sup></span></i> for the dominant allele and <i>X<span class="sub"><sup>r</sup></span></i> for the recessive allele, write the genotypes of the two parents.<br>
<b>d.</b> Do the female offspring all have the same genotype? List the likely genotype(s) of the female offspring.<br>
<b>e.</b> List the genotype of the red-eyed males and the genotype of the ruby-eyed males.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="10images/10-cr-17.gif" width="280" height="163" alt="table showing results of a cross of two red-eyed fruit flies"></p>

<p><b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> The diagram shows three gene loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes.<br>
<b>a.</b> Of the three genes found on this pair of homologous chromosomes, which two are most likely to be separated from each other by a crossover event? Explain.<br>
<b>b.</b> If no crossovers occurred between any of the genes, list the possible combinations of alleles in this individual's gametes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="10images/10-cr-18.gif" width="180" height="114" alt="diagram showing three gene loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>19. Evaluating Models</b> Explain how the table of outcomes for the pennies presented in Concept 10.2 helps explain the outcome of a cross of two F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> offspring. What do the two sides represent? </p>
  
<p><b>20. Problem Solving</b> Tim and Christine have freckles (a dominant trait that is not sex-linked), but their son Michael does not. Show with a Punnett square how this is possible. Tim and Christine are expecting a baby. What is the probability of freckles in that child?</p>

<p><b>21. Analyzing Scientific Explanations</b> Suppose a friend in biology class says: "There are just two alleles for every gene." Another of your friends says: "There are many alleles for some genes." In what way are they both correct? Explain.</p>

<p><b>22. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> If the first time you flip a penny you see a tail, the next flip is more likely to show a head.<br>
<b>b.</b> If you buy two plants of the same species that have different-colored flowers, they must have different genotypes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> When a horse breeder mates two true-breeding horses, one of which is dark brown and the other white, she produces a horse called a palomino that is creamy gold in color. Formulate a hypothesis to explain what kind of inheritance pattern this is. Design an experiment the horse breeder could perform to test this hypothesis.</p>
