</p>

<p>The work of biologists that established the chromosome basis of Mendel's principles also led to an understanding of the role that sex chromosomes play in a unique pattern of inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sex-Linked Genes</span><br>
As you learned in Chapter 9, many species including humans have sex chromosomes, designated <i>X</i> and <i>Y,</i> that are associated with determining an individual's sex. The eggs contain a single <i>X</i> chromosome. Of the sperm cells, half contain an <i>X</i> chromosome and half contain a <i>Y</i> chromosome. An offspring's sex depends on whether the sperm cell that fertilizes the egg carries an <i>X</i> or a <i>Y.</i></p>

<p>Any gene that is located on a sex chromosome is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsexlink.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsexlink.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sex-linked gene</a>. In humans, most sex-linked genes are found on the <i>X</i> chromosome, which is considerably larger than the <i>Y</i> chromosome. Sex-linked genes were discovered by Thomas Hunt Morgan while he was studying the inheritance of white eye color in fruit flies. White eyes are very rare in natural fruit fly populations. Normally, fruit flies have red eyes.</p>

<p>Figure 10-16 shows the eye color inheritance patterns that Morgan observed, along with the genotypes that he eventually figured out. When he mated a white-eyed male fly with a red-eyed female fly, all the F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> offspring had red eyes. This result suggested that the allele for red eyes was dominant. When Morgan bred those F<span class="sub"><sub>1</sub></span> offspring with each other, he got the classical 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of red-eyed to white-eyed flies in the F<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> generation.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>However, there was a surprising twist: none of the flies with white eyes was female. Morgan realized that in these flies, eye color must somehow be tied to sex.</p>

<p>From this and other evidence, Morgan deduced that the gene involved in this inheritance pattern is located only on the X chromosome. There is no corresponding eye color locus on the Y. Thus, females (XX) carry two copies of the gene for this character, while males (XY) carry only one. Because the white-eye allele is recessive, a female will have white eyes only if she has the white-eye allele on <i>both</i> her X chromosomes. However, in males, a <i>single</i> copy of the white-eye allele on the lone X chromosome will lead to white eyes because no other allele is present. In Figure 10-16, <i>X<span class="sub"><sup>R</sup></span></i> represents the dominant, red-eye allele located on the X chromosome. <i>X<span class="sub"><sup>r</sup></span></i> represents the recessive, white-eye allele located on the X chromosome.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sex-linked Disorders</span><br>
Fruit fly genetics helps explain certain patterns in human inheritance. For example, a number of human conditions, including red-green color blindness and hemophilia (a disease in which blood fails to clot normally), are inherited as sex-linked (X-linked) recessive traits. These human conditions are inherited in the same way as the white-eye trait in fruit flies. The fruit fly model also shows why recessive sex-linked traits are much more common in men than in women. Like a male fruit fly, if a human male inherits the sex-linked recessive allele from his mother, the allele will be expressed. In contrast, a female must inherit two such alleles&#151;one from each parent&#151;to exhibit the trait. You will read more about sex-linked disorders in humans in Chapter 12.</p>

<span class="setextsub">Concept Check 10.5</span><br>
		<b>1.</b> Describe why one would expect to find more white-eyed male fruit flies than white-eyed females in natural populations.<br>
		<b>2.</b> A man with hemophilia and a homozygous non-hemophiliac woman have a son. Is it possible that the son will inherit hemophilia? Why or why not?<br>
