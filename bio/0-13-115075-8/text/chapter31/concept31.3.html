<p>If you have ever had chicken pox, you probably won't get it again. This is because your immune system has a remarkable "memory." It "remembers" the virus that causes chicken pox. The next time you are exposed to this pathogen, your body recognizes and destroys the virus before it can trigger symptoms of the illness.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Antigens and Antibodies</span><br>
After you have had the chicken pox, mumps, or measles, you become immune to those diseases. <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gimmunit.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gimmunit.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Immunity</a> means that your body is resistant to the pathogen that causes a specific disease. In general, you acquire immunity by becoming infected by the pathogen. But how does your body recognize and remember each pathogen it encounters?</p>

<p>The surfaces of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, pollen, and other cells contain certain molecules called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gantigen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gantigen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">antigens</a>. An antigen is a large molecule, usually a protein, that provokes an immune response. The word <i>antigen</i> is a contraction meaning "<i>anti</i>body-<i>gen</i>erating." <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gantibod.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gantibod.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Antibodies</a> are proteins found on the surface of certain white blood cells, or in blood plasma, that attach to particular antigens.</p>

<p>The most common antibodies are Y-shaped molecules that look a bit like "rabbit-ear" antennae. At the tip of each arm of the Y is an antigen-binding site, or antigen receptor. The shape of this binding site makes it possible for the antibody to recognize a specific antigen with a complementary shape. Each antigen sits on the surface of the invading particle and has a particular shape with knobs that protrude from the surface. The knobs, also known as "markers," are unique for each antigen. For example, the markers found on the chicken pox virus are different from the markers found on the measles virus. Just as a particular key's shape enables it to fit into a specific lock, the antigen marker fits into a specific antibody. There is a huge variety in the three-dimensional shapes of antigen-binding sites. This variety gives antibodies the ability to recognize an equally large variety of antigens.</p>

<p>Rather than directly engulfing pathogens, antibodies work indirectly in destroying them. An antibody "tags" the invader by binding to the antigen molecule (Figure 31-10). This triggers mechanisms that neutralize or destroy the invader.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>In one such mechanism, the binding of antibodies stops viruses from attaching to a host cell. This disables the virus and halts further infection. In another example, an antibody might bind to the toxin-producing molecules on the surface of a bacterial cell. This makes the pathogen harmless and tags it for destruction by phagocytes. In still another mechanism, antibodies cause pathogens to clump together. This clumping makes the cells easy targets for phagocytes to capture and destroy.</p>

<p>Antibodies may also activate immune system chemicals called complement proteins that can attach to viral surfaces or bacterial membranes. These proteins help to clump viruses for phagocytosis by white blood cells or puncture holes in a bacterial outer membrane, causing the pathogen to break open. All of these antibody mechanisms involve a specific recognition and attack phase, followed by a nonspecific destruction phase.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Lymphocytes</span><br>
The white blood cells that recognize specific invaders are called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes originate in bone marrow from stem cells, which also give rise to various other kinds of cells (Figure 31-11). Some lymphocytes, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbcell.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbcell.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">B cells</a> or B lymphocytes, continue their development in bone marrow. Others, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtcell.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtcell.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">T cells</a> or T lymphocytes, are transported to the thymus gland where they mature. Eventually both B and T cells travel in the blood to the lymph nodes and other parts of the lymphatic system.</p>

</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Not all B cells or T cells are alike. The body has an enormous diversity of these cells, each specialized to recognize and react to a particular antigen marker. This ability to target a particular antigen is due to the specific shapes of the antigen receptors on the lymphocyte surface.</p>

<p>During the development of lymphocytes, many different antigen receptors are generated. However, the body destroys those lymphocytes with antigen receptors that could react against the body's own molecules and cells. Thus, by the time an individual is born, the immune system can distinguish self (the body's own cells) from nonself (foreign substances).</p>

<p>The types of lymphocytes have different functions. B cells play a key role in humoral immunity, while T cells play the major role in cell-mediated immunity.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">B Cells and Humoral Immunity</span><br>
Antibody proteins are embedded on the surface of B cells as specific receptors for antigens. In total, researchers estimate there are approximately 100 million different B cell surfaces. That's enough to recognize almost any kind of antigen you are likely to ever encounter.</p>

<p>B cells defend primarily against bacteria and viruses that are found outside of cells in body fluids. When fighting a pathogen, a B cell containing the matching antigen receptor binds to the antigens of the pathogen. This activates the B cell. Activation means that the B cell grows and clones itself, forming millions of identical cells (Figure 31-12). Each of those cells is capable of developing into a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplascel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplascel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasma cell</a>, which produces and secretes antibodies specific to the antigen that activated the original B cell. The plasma cells are carried in the lymph and blood to sites of infection throughout the body. Since antibodies travel in the blood and other body fluids, immunity that originates from B cells is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghumoral.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghumoral.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">humoral immunity</a> (the body fluids were once called "humors").</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsub">T Cells and Cell-Mediated Immunity</span><br>
T cells work by directly attacking host cells that contain multiplying bacteria or viruses. These host cells are actually body cells that have become infected. Since T cells attack other cells, they produce a type of immunity called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellmed.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellmed.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cell-mediated immunity</a>.</p>

<p>How do T cells recognize infected cells? Each T cell has receptors for a specific antigen. When a pathogen infects a body cell, the pathogen's antigens are displayed on the surface of the body cell. Those antigens bind to the receptors of the "matching" T cell, which activates the T cell. The activated T cell then divides and produces millions of identical clones. These clones develop into <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcytotox.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcytotox.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cytotoxic T cells</a>, which then attack cells infected with the pathogen that triggered the response. Cytotoxic T cells bind to an infected cell's membrane and poke holes in it by secreting a protein called perforin (think "perforate"). The infected cell leaks fluid, breaks open, and dies.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">T Cells and Cancer</span> Research indicates that individuals with weakened immune systems are more likely to get cancer. This suggests that the immune system is important in fighting some cancers. Certain B cells play a role in this battle. Researchers are studying how T cells may also be involved. They have learned that some changes that lead to cancer occur on the outer membrane of body cells. Scientists have hypothesized that the altered membrane may alert T cells to an intruder in the body. Cytotoxic T cells then proceed to destroy the cancer cells. Why this system sometimes fails is a key question in cancer research.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Central Role of Helper T Cells</span> So far you have read that the immune system has two different responses to pathogens: humoral and cell-mediated immunity. During the humoral response, B cells produce antibodies after being activated by free antigens present in body fluids. During the cell-mediated response, cytotoxic T cells attack infected cells that display the antigens of pathogens on their surface.</p>

<p>Both humoral and cell-mediated immunity get a boost from a particular type of lymphocyte called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghelpert.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghelpert.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">helper T cells</a>. Like all lymphocytes, helper T cells are present in many versions, each with surface receptors that recognize a specific antigen (Figure 31-14). Like cytotoxic T cells, the helper T cells are activated by binding to cells that display antigens of a pathogen. But the antigen-displaying cells that helper T cells recognize are macrophages, the white blood cells that eat pathogens by phagocytosis. The marked macrophages serve as an "announcement" that a pathogen is present. Helper T cells respond to this announcement by secreting chemicals that activate both cytotoxic T cells and B cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Primary and Secondary Immune Responses</span><br> When you are first exposed to a pathogen, specific B and T cells multiply and defend against that particular pathogen. Some of that "brand" of B and T cells remain in your body. These long-lasting lymphocytes are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmemoryc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmemoryc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">memory cells</a> (Figure 31-15). The first formation of B and T cells to battle a new invading pathogen is called the primary immune response. This first response is relatively slow and weak because time is needed for enough specific lymphocytes to form to defeat the pathogen.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="425" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="31images/31-15.gif" width="300" height="561" ALT="Figure 31-15"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><br><span class="setextcaption">Figure 31-15<br>The first exposure to a pathogen produces B and T memory cells specific to that pathogen. A second exposure activates those memory cells.</span></td>
								</tr>
					</table></p>

<p>A second exposure to the same pathogen triggers a much quicker and stronger response called the secondary immune response. The B and T memory cells for that pathogen recognize and quickly respond to this repeat visit. The second exposure stimulates the memory B cells to rapidly produce plasma cells that will secrete antibodies specific to that antigen. Meanwhile memory T cells rapidly produce large numbers of cytotoxic T cells that attack cells infected with the pathogen. The process is so quick that you don't develop symptoms of the disease. Your body destroys the invader before you feel sick.</p>
