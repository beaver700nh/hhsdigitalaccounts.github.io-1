<p>Until the 1950s, a disease called polio crippled and killed hundreds of thousands of people. Dr. Jonas Salk developed a procedure to inject healthy children with poliovirus that had been chemically disabled. Much like a sparring partner functions to prepare a boxer for a future boxing match, the disabled virus stimulates healthy immune systems to produce antibodies that can fight future invasions by the functional poliovirus.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Vaccines</span><br>
Earlier you read that being infected with a pathogen can result in natural immunity. Antigens of the pathogen stimulate an immune response and, among other results, memory cells are formed. These memory cells reside in the body and provide lasting resistance to that specific pathogen.</p>

<p>However, some pathogens can cause serious illness or death as a result of the first exposure, as in the case of polio. For those pathogens, or when a person's immune system is in a weakened state, natural immunity isn't much help. For some of these diseases, a vaccine can stimulate the immune response and formation of memory cells before exposure to the real pathogen. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvaccine.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvaccine.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">vaccine</a> is a dose of a pathogen or part of a pathogen that has been disabled or destroyed so it is no longer harmful.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>Some vaccines are made from just the antigens of the pathogen. The antigens in the vaccine stimulate the immune response (Figure 31-16 above). Other vaccines are created by grinding up or heating the dangerous pathogen so that it is no longer functional. Some vaccines consist of a slightly different version of the pathogen that "fools" the body into reacting as if exposed to the real antigen. For example, the vaccine for the virus that causes smallpox (a deadly disease) is actually made from a closely related virus that causes cowpox (a mild disease). The two antigens are so similar that your immune system launches a full fight in the presence of either antigen. Vaccines have proven to be effective in reducing the occurrence of many diseases (Figure 31-17).</p>

<p>You may remember receiving a "booster" shot of a vaccine, such as the one for tetanus, at a doctor's visit. This shot is an additional dose of an antigen that "boosts" antibody production and extends the memory for that antigen. The booster is necessary because some of the initial memory cells that were produced after the first shot have died.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Active and Passive Immunity</span><br>
Whenever your body produces antibodies against infection, the result is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gactivei.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gactivei.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">active immunity</a>. Active immunity can develop from catching a disease such as chicken pox or from receiving a vaccine, such as that for polio. In contrast, when your body receives antibodies for a particular disease from another source, the result is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpassive.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpassive.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">passive immunity</a>. For example, a fetus receives antibodies by transfer from the mother's bloodstream to its own. In another example, travelers to some foreign countries receive various shots containing antibodies rather than antigens. These antibodies temporarily protect the travelers in the event of exposure to particular diseases, such as various forms of hepatitis, in the country they will be visiting. Passive immunity only lasts a few weeks or months because the antibodies in the shots disintegrate over time, and the recipient does not make his or her own antibodies against that pathogen.</p>
