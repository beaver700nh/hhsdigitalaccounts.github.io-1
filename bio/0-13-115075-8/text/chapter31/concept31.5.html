<p>The immune system is the body's protector against disease. But occasionally the immune system malfunctions or attacks the body's own tissues with harmful effects. And sometimes a pathogen, such as the virus that causes AIDS, actually attacks the immune system itself and destroys it.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Allergies</span><br>
You may be one of several million people who sneeze and cough around pollen, dust, cats, or dogs. The runny, itchy nose, watery eyes, and frequent sneezing that accompany exposure to these substances are allergic reactions. An <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gallergy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gallergy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">allergy</a> is an abnormal over-sensitivity to an otherwise non-harmful antigen, called an allergen. If you are allergic to dust, for instance, your immune system is overly sensitive to allergens in the feces of tiny mites that live in household dust. Many people who are allergic to cats or dogs are actually responding to allergens in the animal's saliva.</p>

<p>Another example, hay fever, is an allergic response to pollen released from grasses or plants such as ragweed (Figure 31-18). The pollen grains have allergens on their surface that trigger B cells to produce a class of antibodies different from those that protect against pathogens. These "allergic antibodies" attach to receptor proteins on the surface of cells called mast cells that produce histamine. As you read in Concept 31.2, histamine triggers the inflammatory response, which, in the case of allergies, includes watery eyes and a runny nose. These "watery" symptoms are caused by histamine dilating local blood vessels, which results in more liquid filling the interstitial area of the eyes and nose. One treatment for allergies is a class of medications called "antihistamines." These drugs block the action of histamine, minimizing the symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>Most allergies are a nuisance. But some allergies are life-threatening. For example, when some people eat peanuts or are stung by a bee, they suffer a sudden, dramatic drop in blood pressure and have difficulty breathing. This dangerous type of allergic reaction, called anaphylactic shock, can be a potentially fatal condition. People who are severely allergic to bees often carry a self-injection kit containing epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that counteracts the allergy's symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Autoimmune Diseases</span><br>
The human immune system is highly effective. It protects the body against a vast diversity of harmful invaders. But, in some individuals, the immune system cannot always distiguish between self and non-self. In such cases, the immune system turns against some of the body's own molecules, resulting in an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gautoimm.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gautoimm.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">autoimmune disease</a>. Examples of autoimmune diseases include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Lupus occurs when the body makes antibodies that reacts with to some of the body's own tissues as if they were foreign. Since any tissue or organ of the body can be attacked, symptoms of the disease are varied. They can include fever, weakness, weight loss, anemia, and a butterfly-shaped rash on the face.</p>

<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is another autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of antibodies that attack the body's own tissues. The immune system attacks cartilage and bone joints, causing damage and painful inflammation. When rheumatoid arthritis strikes people under the age of 16, the disease is referred to as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that strikes the central nervous system. T cells attack the myelin sheaths that cover the axons of some neurons. As you read in Chapter 28, the myelin sheath plays a key role in the transmission of nerve signals. Disrupting the signals can cause mild symptoms, such as fatigue, tingling, and numbness. More advanced cases may interfere with walking, talking, memory, and concentration.</p>

<p>Scientists have not determined the exact causes of autoimmune diseases. Evidence points to a combination of contributing factors including genetics, exposure to toxic chemicals, and certain viruses. Medicines for autoimmune diseases generally replace the destroyed "self" molecules, suppress the immune response, or treat specific symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">AIDS&#151;A Disease of the Immune System</span><br>
In the past two decades, AIDS has killed more than 11 million people worldwide. <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaids.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaids.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">AIDS</a> stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A virus called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghiv.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghiv.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">HIV</a>, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. More than 40 million people are now infected with the AIDS virus, HIV.</p>

<p>HIV is deadly because it destroys the immune system, leaving the body unable to defend itself against pathogens and certain cancers. HIV infects a variety of immune system cells, especially helper T cells. When HIV destroys the body's helper T cells, the immune system cannot activate other T cells or B cells. Both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are impaired, and the body cannot fight pathogens (Figure 31-21). Death usually occurs from another infection, such as pneumonia, or from certain types of cancer.</p>

<p>The AIDS virus is transmitted mainly in semen and blood. Most often it enters a person's body during sexual contact or via needles contaminated with infected blood. Screening of donated blood has reduced the risk from blood transfusions, but the sharing of needles to inject illegal drugs remains a major source of infection. The rate of new infections also continues to rise worldwide among sexually active people.</p>

<p>At present AIDS is incurable, although newly developed drugs have slowed the progress of AIDS in infected individuals and decreased the number of deaths in the United States. Unfortunately, HIV mutates frequently and evolves rapidly. This makes the development of a vaccine difficult, since the mutated forms of the virus have different antigens. At present, education about preventing infection remains the best weapon against AIDS.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Body's Reaction to Organ Transplants</span><br>
An organ transplant replaces a damaged organ or part of an organ with a healthy organ or tissue. Some common organ transplants involve the kidney, cornea, skin, and liver. Just about every time a transplant occurs, the recipient's immune system wages a battle against the transplanted organ. This reaction is the normal process of self/non-self recognition. The transplanted organ is identified as non-self tissue and triggers an immune response.</p>

<p>Transplants that raise the fewest complications are those between identical twins or if the transplant is within the same individual, as in a skin graft. The immune system will more likely recognize genetically similar tissue as self tissue. In all transplants, medications are necessary to suppress the immune response to foreign organs. Cyclosporine is a drug commonly used to suppress the immune system and decrease the possibility of rejection. However, suppressing the immune system increases the patient's risk of infection. Despite the complications, transplant recipients can often lead full and active lives.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Keeping Your Immune System Healthy</span><br>
Although you cannot always avoid illnesses, you can take steps to help your immune system in fighting many infectious diseases. Washing your hands before eating and after using the bathroom reduces the number of pathogens that enter your body. Eating a balanced diet will provide your body with adequate nutrients to maintain your immune system. Getting enough sleep will give your body time to restore itself.</p>

<p>The immune system is especially affected by the body's response to stress. As you will read in Chapter 32, the body releases certain chemicals when experiencing stress. These chemicals can suppress the immune system, making you more vulnerable to disease. Stress may be unavoidable, but learning to manage your stress will help your immune system function.</p>
