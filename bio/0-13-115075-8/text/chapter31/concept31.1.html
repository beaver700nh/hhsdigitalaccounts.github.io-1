<p>Between 1345 and 1350 C.E. approximately 25 million people (one out of four) in Europe died from a disease called the plague. Many people at the time believed the disease was caused by breathing foul-smelling air. Some treatments therefore included burning pleasant-smelling incense. Not surprisingly, this method did little to ward off the disease, which is actually caused by a bacterium carried by rats. Knowing the real cause of a disease helps scientists develop useful methods of prevention and cures.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Germ Theory of Disease</span><br>
Today, scientists know more about <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpathoge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpathoge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pathogens</a>, or disease-causing organisms or viruses. Pathogens include certain bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and worms, and viruses. Diseases that are caused by pathogens are known as <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginfecti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginfecti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">infectious diseases</a> (Figure 31-1). </p>

<p>Most of the current understanding about infectious disease has developed in the last 150 years. In the mid-1800s, the French biochemist Louis Pasteur conducted a series of experiments involving the microorganisms (yeasts) responsible for alcoholic fermentation. Pasteur demonstrated that other microorganisms could contaminate fermenting wine or beer. These contaminations interfered with the normal fermentation process.</p>

<p>Around the same time in England, surgeon Joseph Lister read about Pasteur's work. Lister was dismayed that as many as 50 percent of patients who had surgery died from infections afterward. Pasteur's work led Lister to hypothesize that microorganisms caused these infections. Lister's experiments involved using carbolic acid to wash instruments and the surgeons' hands before operations. As a result, deaths from infections after surgery in his hospital dropped to 15 percent.</p>

<p>Pasteur, Lister, and other researchers contributed to the development of the germ theory of disease. This theory states that infectious disease is caused by pathogens that can spread the disease from one organism to another organism.</p>

<p>A few years later Robert Koch, a German physician, built upon the previous work of Pasteur and Lister. Koch developed a process to identify numerous specific pathogens, such as the different bacteria that cause anthrax and tuberculosis. Koch's method is still used to establish whether or not a specific pathogen causes a certain illness (Figure 31-2).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Transmission of Infectious Disease</span><br>
Once the cause of an infectious disease is determined, the next step in controlling the disease is to understand how it is transmitted. Some diseases are transmitted when airborne pathogens are inhaled. Some are transmitted by physical contact such as a handshake. For example, a virus can be transferred from an infected person's hand to your hand. If you then touch your nose, mouth, or eyes, you can transfer the virus to your mucous membranes&#151;ideal locations for the virus to invade cells and multiply.</p>

<p>Other diseases are transmitted through contaminated water or food. And some are passed along by sexual contact. In other cases, an animal acts as an agent to transmit the disease. For example, deer ticks (black-legged ticks) can transmit the bacterium that causes Lyme disease to humans (Lyme disease causes fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and nerve tissue damage). Ticks feed by penetrating the skin of a host and slowly taking in blood. When a tick infected with the bacterium <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> bites a human, the bacterium can be transferred. Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early.</p>
