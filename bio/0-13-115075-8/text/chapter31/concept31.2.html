</p>

<p>The first line of defense consists of barriers against invasion, somewhat like a wall around a castle. The second line includes chemicals and cells that attack pathogens that get past the "wall." And the third line of defense targets specific pathogens and is responsible for identifying and quickly attacking the same pathogens in the future.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The First Line: Barriers</span><br>
Your body's first line of defense against pathogens consists of physical and chemical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body. These barriers are <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnonspec.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnonspec.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nonspecific defenses</a>, meaning they do not distinguish one invader from another. Your skin is one example of such a barrier. The outer layer of the skin is comprised of tough, dead cells that most bacteria and other organisms cannot penetrate. Also this layer of skin is constantly shedding, which makes it difficult for bacteria to embed in it and grow.</p>

<p>As you read in Chapter 27, your skin also contains sweat and oil glands. These glands secrete acids and oils that prevent the growth of many microorganisms, acting as a chemical barrier. Furthermore, sweat contains lysozyme, an enzyme that breaks down the cell walls of many bacteria.</p>

<p>While skin covers most of your body, the mouth, eyes, and nostrils are all areas through which pathogens could enter. Saliva and tears contain lysozyme, which helps protect the mouth and eyes from bacterial invasion. In addition, your digestive and respiratory passageways are lined with mucous membranes, another barrier. Mucus in the trachea, for example, creates a sticky barrier that traps microorganisms. Cilia move these trapped particles up to the pharynx where they are swallowed. Then, stomach acids and enzymes help to destroy the pathogens, as well as many other microorganisms in your food and drink.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Second Line: Internal Nonspecific Defenses</span><br>
Pathogens are always present in the environment. Sometimes pathogens gain access to your body despite the barriers of your first line of defense. For example, when you are bitten by an insect or prick your finger with a pin, your skin is broken, and pathogens can enter your body tissues. When this happens, the invaders are met by your body's second line of defense. The second line of defense includes certain pathogen-destroying white blood cells, the inflammatory response, and certain specialized proteins. Since they do not single out specific pathogens, these defenses are also said to be nonspecific, like the first line of defense.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">White Blood Cells</span> Certain white blood cells roam through the bloodstream, interstitial fluid, and lymphatic system attacking invaders. Some, such as macrophages and neutrophils, destroy microorganisms through phagocytosis (meaning "cellular eating"). Macrophages (meaning "big eaters") are found mainly in interstitial fluid. When a macrophage encounters an invading pathogen, the macrophage engulfs the organism much as an amoeba ingests food. The pathogen is drawn into the macrophage, where enzymes such as lysozyme kill the pathogen.</p>

<p>Neutrophils are smaller and more numerous in the body than macrophages. Neutrophils also kill by phagocytosis. Once the pathogen is inside the neutrophil, the neutrophil releases chemicals (similar to bleach) that kill the invading pathogen. However, these chemicals also kill the neutrophil.</p>

<p>Key to these responses is the white blood cells' ability to identify which structures to attack, and which to leave alone. White blood cells can identify certain proteins and carbohydrates on the surface of an invading pathogen. Recognizing these "foreign" molecules triggers the cells' responses.</p>

<p>Another type of white blood cell called a natural killer (NK) cell is found in the bloodstream. Unlike macrophages and neutrophils, NK cells do not attack pathogens directly or kill by phagocytosis. Instead, they recognize body cells that have become infected by a virus and kill them by releasing chemicals that poke holes in the infected cell's membrane. NK cells also recognize and attack abnormal body cells such as cancer cells. They play a key role in defending against cancer by killing abnormal cells before they can form a tumor.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Inflammatory Response</span> At the site of pathogen invasion, such as a pinprick or an insect bite, certain cells release a variety of chemical "alarms." These chemical alarms trigger an <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginflamm.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginflamm.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">inflammatory response</a>, a nonspecific defense characterized by redness, heat, swelling, and pain. For example, cells called mast cells release a type of chemical alarm called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghistami.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghistami.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">histamine</a>, which causes nearby blood vessels to dilate (expand). The expanded blood vessels increase the volume of blood flowing to the injured tissue. In addition, the vessels become more porous, allowing more blood plasma to leak into the interstitial fluid. Other chemicals attract additional phagocytes and other white blood cells to the area, where they pass through the leaky blood vessel walls into the interstitial fluid (Figure 31-6). This local increase of blood flow, fluid, and white blood cells produces the redness, heat, swelling, and pain you may experience around the injured area.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The major function of the inflammatory response includes removing pathogens and cleaning injured tissues. Inflammation may occur in a tiny area, such as the site of a mosquito bite. Or, if pathogens get into the blood or release toxins that are carried throughout the body by the circulatory system, the whole body may react with an inflammatory response. In such a response white blood cells increase and a fever (an abnormally high body temperature) may occur. A very high fever may be dangerous, because it can destroy proteins and cause other damage. But a moderate fever may contribute to defense by stimulating phagocytosis and stopping the growth of many kinds of microorganisms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Specialized Proteins</span> Other internal nonspecific defenses include specialized proteins that either attack invaders directly or block their reproduction. One example is <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginterfe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginterfe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">interferon</a>, a family of proteins produced by cells in response to becoming infected by a virus. The infected cell may die, but its interferon reaches healthy cells in the area, stimulating them to produce proteins that interfere with virus reproduction (Figure 31-8). Interferon is effective against many viruses and is therefore nonspecific. Interferon seems to be effective against viruses that cause the flu and the common cold.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 31-8<br>Infected cells produce interferon, which stimulates noninfected cells to manufacture substances that block virus reproduction.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The body can only produce interferon in small amounts. However, the recombinant DNA technology described in Chapter 13 has enabled the drug industry to manufacture interferon in large quantities to be used to treat certain viral infections.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Third Line: Targeted Defense</span><br>
Supporting the nonspecific defenses is your body's third line of defense, the immune system. This system recognizes and defends against <i>specific</i> pathogens, cancer cells, and certain chemicals. The third line is therefore a specific, or targeted, defense. To accomplish this, the immune system must be able to distinguish between its own body cells ("self") and intruders ("non-self"). When non-self cells or other intruders are identified, the immune system launches a customized response, as you will read in Concept 31.3. Such a response may take longer, but it is longer-lasting and often more effective than nonspecific defenses.</p>
