<p>On a brisk winter day, you shiver in response to the cold temperature. On a hot and sticky summer day, you may sweat profusely. These two very different physiological responses to temperature extremes are your body's ways of achieving the same thing: stability.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Homeostasis</span><br>
In both cold and hot weather, your body maintains a steady temperature of about 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F). This is just one example of how your body buffers itself from changes in the <i>external</i> environment, providing a relatively stable <i>internal</i> environment. This stability is important because your tissues can only survive within a narrow range of conditions. The internal stability or "steady state" maintained by your body is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghomeost.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghomeost.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">homeostasis</a> (hoh mee oh STAY sis).</p>

<p>The narrow range of operating conditions is defined by <i>set points</i>. You can think of set points as "normal" levels. To better understand this idea, think about the thermostat in your home. You set your thermostat at a comfortable temperature&#151;this is its set point. The thermostat turns on the furnace when the indoor temperature drops below the set point and turns it off when the temperature rises above the set point. This keeps the home temperature close to the set point.</p>

<p>Your body's "thermostat," located in your brain, switches on and off many mechanisms that maintain a nearly constant temperature. Two of these mechanisms are shivering and sweating. Shivering is caused by the rapid contraction of skeletal muscles. The muscles release heat that helps maintain your body temperature on a cold day. And on a hot day or during exercise, sweating causes evaporative cooling (see Chapter 4). Sweating thus helps keep the body from overheating.</p>

<p>Many chemical signals help regulate the body systems that contribute to homeostasis. For example, your neurons release signal molecules that stimulate the muscles that make you shiver. Other signal molecules called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghormone.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghormone.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hormones</a> are released by glands into the bloodstream. The hormones are carried to other parts of the body where they trigger particular responses. You can investigate one type of hormonal regulation in Online Activity 27.3, and you can learn more about your body's ability to maintain homeostasis in Chapter 32.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Chemical Exchange With the Surroundings</span><br>
In maintaining homeostasis, two environments are important: the external environment surrounding your body and the internal environment surrounding your individual cells. Your body exchanges chemicals with the external environment, and then your cells exchange materials with the internal environment (Figure 27-9). The internal exchange takes place through an aqueous solution called <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginterst.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginterst.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">interstitial fluid</a> (in tur STISH ul) that fills the gaps between cells in a tissue. Chemicals traveling between the blood and tissue cells pass through the interstitial fluid. For example, oxygen enters your body from the external environment when you inhale. In your lungs, oxygen diffuses through interstitial fluid into the blood. From the blood, oxygen moves to your cells by passing through the interstitial fluid and the plasma membranes of individual cells. Cells use oxygen for cellular respiration and produce carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide passes from a cell to the interstitial fluid and then to the blood. The carbon dioxide is then carried to your lungs where it can be exhaled.</p>

<p>Your circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and excretory systems in particular perform a great deal of chemical exchange with the rest of the body. For all the cells of these systems to receive and deliver chemicals, they must be bathed in interstitial fluid. In another example of structure fitting function, the epithelial tissues of these systems have textured or branched surfaces that enhance chemical exchange. For example, your lungs have millions of microscopic air sacs with a total gas-exchanging surface about the size of a tennis court. Oxygen and carbon dioxide move across the surface between these air sacs and the bloodstream. Another example is the finger-like bumps called villi on the epilthelium lining the small intestine. In contrast to a flat surface, this bumpy surface greatly expands the total area across which nutrients can pass from your intestine to your bloodstream after you eat.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Integumentary System</span><br>
While maintaining homeostasis is a function of all your organ systems, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gintegum.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gintegum.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">integumentary system</a> (in teg yoo MEN tuh ree)&#151;the body's outer covering&#151;has the important task of physically separating the body from the external environment. This barrier is important for maintaining homeostasis.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Skin</span> The largest and most familiar organ of the integumentary system is the skin. Though it is only about 2 millimeters thick (the thickness of two compact discs), the skin consists of two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis (Figure 27-11). The <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gepiderm.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gepiderm.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">epidermis</a>, the outermost layer of skin, is made mostly of dead epithelial cells that continually flake and fall off. New cells pushing up from lower layers are constantly replacing the cells that are lost. This ongoing renewal of your outer covering is necessary because your skin is often scratched or otherwise damaged. Not all the cells of the epidermis are dead, however. For example, the bottom region of the epidermis contains living cells that produce <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmelanin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmelanin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">melanin</a>, a pigmented protein that gives your skin its color. </p>

<p>The <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdermis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdermis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dermis</a> is the skin layer that lies beneath and supports the epidermis. The dermis is made mostly of fibrous connective tissue, giving the skin its strength and elasticity. The dermis also contains hair follicles, oil and sweat glands, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Below the dermis is a tissue layer called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghypoder.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghypoder.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hypodermis</a>. The hypodermis contains a kind of connective tissue called adipose tissue, which includes fat-storing cells and blood vessels.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Hair and Nails</span> Hair and nails are also part of your integumentary system. Hair covers almost all of your body. Over much of the body surface, hair is so short and sparse that you hardly notice it. Hair is composed of a protein called keratin. It is formed in pockets called hair follicles deep in the dermis layer. The follicle cells produce and deposit keratin at the base of each hair shaft, causing the hair to grow. Your fingernails and toenails are also made of keratin, and they too grow as they are pushed outward by living cells beneath.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Role in Homeostasis</span> Your integumentary system helps your body maintain homeostasis in several ways. The skin provides a physical barrier against dirt and microorganisms entering your body. Its layered construction also helps to insulate the body on cold days and to cushion internal organs against physical injury. Your skin further helps maintain homeostasis by responding to such stimuli as slight changes in body temperature and water content. For example, you read at the beginning of this section that if your body temperature begins to rise above normal, you respond in part by sweating through pores in your skin.</p> 

<p>Hair also helps maintain homeostasis. Hair on the top of your head protects your scalp from the harming effects of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It also provides a layer of insulation from the changing outside temperatures. Your eyebrows and eyelashes prevent dirt and other small particles from entering your eyes.</p> 

<p>Despite all the protection it provides, your integumentary system is not failproof. For example, cuts and other injuries break the barrier of the integumentary system and may allow microorganisms to enter the body. Excessive exposure to the sun may cause damage to connective tissues in the dermis, leading to wrinkles. Excessive sun exposure over time may also cause skin cancer.</p>
