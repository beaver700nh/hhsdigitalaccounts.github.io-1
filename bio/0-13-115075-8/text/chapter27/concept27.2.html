<p>Your body contains about 250 different types of cells. Within this vast landscape of cells, groups of similar cells with a common function are called tissues. Tissues perform a range of functions. Some tissues protect the body, some connect parts of the body together, some transmit information, and some lift and move the body.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Epithelial Tissue</span><br>
Sheets of closely packed cells that cover the entire surface of your body and form the lining of your internal organs are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gepithel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gepithel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">epithelial tissue</a> (ep uh THEE lee ul). There are many different kinds of epithelial tissues. Though each type has a specific structure appropriate to its function, all serve the general function of protecting the tissues and organs that they cover.</p>

<p>Even within an organ system, such as the respiratory system, there are several types of epithelial tissues. One type of epithelial tissue lines your windpipe and its major branches. Its cells secrete mucus and have short brushlike cilia. The mucus traps dust, pollen, and other particles before air enters your lungs. The cilia sweep the mucus upward from the windpipe to your throat, where the mucus can be swallowed. A second type of epithelial tissue lines the narrower airways. Its cells have a smooth surface, which allows air to flow quickly into the lungs.</p>

<p>A third type of epithelial tissue that consists of a single layer of thin, flat cells lines the microscopic air sacs within the lungs. The structure of this thin tissue is well-suited for its particular function: the transfer of carbon dioxide and oxygen between your blood and the air you breathe. The fact that this tissue is only one cell thick minimizes the distance these gases have to travel.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Connective Tissue</span><br>
The main functions of <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gconnect.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gconnect.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">connective tissue</a> are to hold together and support other tissues, and to cushion, insulate, and connect organs. The cells that make up connective tissues are scattered in a matrix of fibers. Loose connective tissue is the most common type, so-called because its matrix is a loose weave of fibers. Like a "living glue," loose connective tissue holds other tissues and organs in place and connects the skin to underlying muscle tissue. Other types of connective tissue include bone, cartilage, blood, and fat (adipose tissue). Connective tissues vary widely in appearance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Nervous Tissue</span><br>
Your survival depends upon your ability to respond appropriately to sudden changes in the environment. For instance, if you touch a hot pan on the stove, your arm pulls away very quickly&#151;even before you know what you've done. Your rapid response minimizes the damage to your body. <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnervous.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnervous.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Nervous tissue</a> forms the communication system that makes this behavior possible. The basic unit of nervous tissue is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gneuron.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gneuron.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">neuron</a>, or nerve cell. Neurons can transmit signals very rapidly over long distances. For example, the neurons in your arm reach all the way from the muscles in the tips of your fingers to your spinal cord. The signal to move your arm is communicated through this connection. In Chapter 28 you'll explore the structure and function of nervous tissue in more detail.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Muscle Tissue</span><br>
Muscles are organs that enable humans to move, to run, to dance, and to swim. They aid in moving your blood, and digesting your food.  Muscles are composed of several different types of tissue, including connective tissue, nervous tissue, and muscle tissue.</p> 

<p>There are three types of muscles. A muscle that you can control under your own will, such as a muscle in your arm or leg, is called a <i>voluntary muscle</i>. A voluntary muscle is also called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gskeleta.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gskeleta.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">skeletal muscle</a> because it is attached to the bones of your skeleton. Skeletal muscles allow you to move the various parts of your body.</p> 

<p>A muscle that works without you consciously controlling it is called an involuntary muscle. The <i>involuntary muscles</i> that cause your heart to pump blood and contain cardiac muscle tissue are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcardiac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcardiac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cardiac muscles</a>. Involuntary that contain smooth muscle tissue and are muscles found in most of your other organs are called, <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsmoothm.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsmoothm.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">smooth muscles</a>. They perform many necessary functions without you having to think about them. For example, smooth muscles in your intestine move food through your digestive system. You'll read more about how muscles work in Concept 27.5.</p>
