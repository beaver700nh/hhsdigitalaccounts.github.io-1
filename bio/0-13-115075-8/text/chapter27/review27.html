 <b>b.</b> epithelial tissue<br>
 <b>c.</b> muscle tissue<br>
 <b>d.</b> connective tissue</p>
  
 <p><b>2.</b> Which of the following is an example of a result of maintaining homeostasis?<br>
 <b>a.</b> steady internal temperature<br>
 <b>b.</b> blood sugar level above normal<br>
 <b>c.</b> exhaustion<br>
 <b>d.</b> voluntary muscle contraction</p>
 
 <p><b>3.</b> Which of the following is <i>not</i> part of the integumentary system?<br>
 <b>a.</b> skin<br>
 <b>b.</b> hair<br>
 <b>c.</b> vertebrae<br>
 <b>d.</b> fingernails</p>
 
<p><b>4.</b> The functions of the human skeletal system include<br>

 <b>b.</b> exchanging chemicals with muscles.<br>
 <b>c.</b> providing attachment sites for muscles.<br>
 <b>d.</b> preventing fluid loss.</p>
 
<p><b>5.</b> Pick the answer that accurately pairs a structure with its function:<br>
 <b>a.</b> sharp front teeth: grinding food<br>
 <b>b.</b> hinge joint: rotating one bone around another bone<br>
 <b>c.</b> highly folded lining of intestine: exchanging nutrients<br>
 <b>d.</b> all of the above</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Which is <i>not</i> true of skeletal muscles?<br>
 <b>a.</b> They work in pairs.<br>
 <b>b.</b> Their cells each have many nuclei.<br>
 <b>c.</b> Myosin and actin interact, which causes contractions.<br>
 <b>d.</b> Their contractions produce heartbeats.</p>
  
<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>7.</b> Explain the relationship between anatomy and physiology.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Give an example of how one of your body structures matches its function(s).</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Name two general functions of connective tissue.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Describe one function of smooth muscles.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Describe the cause and effect of shivering.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Describe the structure and function of the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> What function does the cartilage between your vertebrae have?</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Name two ways people can reduce their risk of osteoporosis.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Describe the difference between ligaments and tendons.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Describe the structure of a skeletal muscle.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Describe the role myosin heads play during muscle contraction.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>19. Analyzing Photographs</b> Examine the photo to answer the questions below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="27images/27-cr-19.jpg" width="250" height="175" alt="muscle micrograph"></p>

<b>a.</b> Which kind of muscle tissue is shown in the photo?<br>
<b>b.</b> Where in the body is this tissue found?<br>
<b>c.</b> How does the shape of the cells of this tissue contribute to the tissue's function?<br>
<b>d.</b> Is the contraction of the muscles containing this tissue voluntary or involuntary?</p>

<p><b>20. Analyzing Data</b> Use the data table below to answer the questions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="27images/27-cr-20.gif" width="270" height="162" alt="temperature reading table"></p>

<b>a.</b> Which location has the greatest change in temperature?<br>
<b>b.</b> Which of these three locations do you think has some kind of homeostatic mechanism? Why?<br>
<b>c.</b> Do the data allow you to conclude whether the human is indoors or outdoors between 8:00 A.M. and noon? Why or why not?</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>  
<b>21. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Give examples of organs in your body with skeletal muscle tissue and with smooth muscle tissue. Desctibe the similarities and differences between the two types of muscles.</p>

<p><b>22. Relating Cause and Effect</b> How might a burn injury to the skin affect your body's ability to maintain homeostasis? Explain.</p>

<p><b>23. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Homeostasis prevents your body from changing.<br>
<b>b.</b> Your bones are hard and brittle.<br>
<b>c.</b> While beating a drum, your arm muscles are contracted.<br>
<b>d.</b> Nonliving cells have no function in the human body.</p>

<p><b>24. Making Generalizations</b> Name an object in your home or classroom that is similar in structure to a hinge joint found in your body. Describe how their functions are similar.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Writing</b> You learned that shaking someone's hand requires tight coordination of your body's systems. Write your own description of your body's coordination during an action you perform while playing your favorite sport.</p>
