<p>Without your skeleton supporting your body from within, you would sag from your own weight into a formless heap. You would also be unable to move&#151;without bones to anchor them, your muscles would be useless.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Anatomy of the Skeleton</span><br>
The skeleton provides a strong framework that holds your body up and maintains its shape (Figure 27-13). The skeleton also protects soft organs and provides attachment sites for your muscles. Starting from the top of the skeleton, the skull houses and protects the brain. The backbone, which protects the spinal cord, consists of a column of small bones, each of which is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvertebr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvertebr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">vertebra</a> (plural, <i>vertebrae</i>). Between the vertebrae are disks made of <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcartila.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcartila.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cartilage</a> (KARH tuh lij), a type of connective tissue that is softer than bone. The cartilage disks act as cushions for the vertebrae and permit the spinal cord to twist and bend. Stretching out from some of the vertebrae is a set of ribs that form a protective cage around the heart and lungs. Your skeleton also includes the bones of your arms, hands, legs, and feet. The bones of your shoulder girdle (the scapula and clavicle) connect your arms to your "core" skeleton. The bones of your pelvic girdle, or hip, join your legs to the core.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Bones as Living Organs</span><br>
Although you might think of bones as dry and lifeless, your bones are organs made up of living connective tissue. Within this very dense connective tissue, a material known as <i>bone matrix</i> surrounds the bone cells. Bone matrix consists of flexible fibers of the protein collagen and a hard mineral made of calcium and phosphate. The collagen keeps the bone flexible and non-brittle, while the hard mineral helps the bone withstand forces that push on it.</p>

<p>A sheet of fibrous connective tissue covers most of the outside surface of the bone (Figure 27-14). This tissue helps form new bone in the event of a fracture. Cartilage cushions the ends of bones and prevents them from rubbing against each other. Your elbows, hips, and knees in particular depend upon cartilage to ensure smooth movement.</p>

						</table></p>


<p>In addition to covering the ends of bones, cartilage is found in the tip of your nose and the outer portion of your ears. When you were a newborn, much of your skeleton was made up of cartilage. As you grew, this cartilage was gradually replaced by bone as minerals circulating in the blood accumulated in the developing bone. Bones continue to grow in length in women until about age 18, and in men until about age 21.</p>

<p>Many bones contain specialized tissues called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmarrow.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmarrow.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">marrow</a>. The shafts of long bones, such as the arm bone (humerus) shown in Figure 27-14, have a central cavity containing yellow bone marrow. Yellow bone marrow consists of stored fat and serves as an energy reserve for the body. Cavities in certain bones, such as the humerus, your hip bones, and your sternum, contain red bone marrow. Red bone marrow produces cells that develop into your body's blood cells, replenishing your blood supply when old blood cells die.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Joints Work</span><br>
An area where one bone meets another bone is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/j/gjoint.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/j/gjoint.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">joint</a>. Some joints connect bones in a way that allows little or no movement. Such joints are called immovable joints. For example, the bones in your skull are fused together with immovable joints. Similarly, your ribs are attached to the vertebrae with immovable joints. By being unable to move, these bones better protect the soft organs that lie beneath them. Yet, if all your bones were fused together in one continuous skeleton, you would not be able to move. Movable joints allow you to bend, twist, and rotate your limbs, neck, and torso. The bones in a movable joint are held together by a strong, fibrous connective tissue called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/gligamen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/gligamen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ligament</a>.</p>

<p>Movable joints can be classified by the way in which the bones come together. The different structures of the joints allow your body to move in a variety of ways. Think about some of the motions a pitcher makes when throwing a softball. The pitcher checks the runner at first by turning her head to the side. The top of her neck and base of her skull form a pivot joint, which enables one bone to rotate around another bone (Figure 27-15). When she winds up for the pitch, she rotates her arm from the shoulder. The shoulder is an example of a <i>ball-and-socket joint,</i> which enables a bone to rotate and move back-and-forth and side-to-side. The "ball" at the end of the humerus fits into the cup-like socket of the scapula. Of all the joints, a ball-and-socket joint allows the greatest range of motion. Next, a <i>gliding joint</i> in the pitcher's wrist (not shown) enables her to bend and flex her wrist to put extra spin on the ball. Gliding joints allow small bones to slide gently over one another. Finally, as the pitcher releases the ball, she leans forward by bending her knee. The knee is an example of a <i>hinge joint,</i> which permits movement only in a single plane&#151;a back-and-forth type of movement.</p>

<p>Many daily activities cause wear and tear on your joints and ligaments. Stretching regularly, especially before exercising, may keep your ligaments flexible and reduce joint injuries.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Skeletal Disorders</span><br>
Have you ever broken a bone? Although bones are very strong, a great enough force can fracture them. Since bones consist of living tissue, they can repair themselves by building new tissue. If properly set using a cast or splint, a bone will usually return to its normal shape and strength.</p> 

<p>Besides fractures, bones and joints can be affected by disorders of the skeletal system. <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/garthrit.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/garthrit.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Arthritis</a> refers to a group of  skeletal disorders that involve inflammation of the joints. One out of every three adults in the United States suffers from arthritis or a related joint disorder. One form of arthritis occurs as part of aging&#151;cartilage between bones wears down, and the joints become swollen, stiff, and sore. In Chapter 31, you will learn how the body's own immune system can cause another kind of arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis).</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gosteopo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gosteopo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Osteoporosis</a> is a disorder in which bones become thinner, more porous, and more easily broken. It particularly affects women after menopause, when changes in hormone levels affect bone strength. Consuming plenty of calcium while a teenager will help you build strong bones and will help prevent osteoporosis in the future. Calcium can be obtained from foods such as milk, cheese, and dark green vegetables such as broccoli. A diet rich in calcium combined with regular exercise will help you build a strong skeleton for a full, active life.</p>
