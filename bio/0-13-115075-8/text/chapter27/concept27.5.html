<p>What do you and the fastest runner on Earth have in common? Star athletes depend on the same type of interaction between skeletal muscles and the skeleton that you depend on when you run to catch the bus in the morning. More than 600 skeletal muscles help drive your body's movement.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Muscles and Bones Work Together</span><br>
Skeletal muscles interact with parts of your skeleton in moving your body. A muscle is attached to a bone by a type of dense connective tissue called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtendon.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtendon.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tendon</a>.</p>

<p>As a muscle contracts, it pulls on the attached bone. Since muscles cannot push, only pull, an opposing motion is needed to return the bone to its original position. Therefore muscles must work in pairs. For each skeletal muscle that is contracting, there is an opposing muscle&#151;one that is relaxed but that can contract and pull the bone back in the opposite direction. For instance, when the bass drummer in a marching band beats the drum, his biceps contracts and his triceps relaxes (Figure 27-17). The opposite occurs when he pulls his arm away from the drum. His biceps relaxes, and his triceps contracts. If you had only one muscle in your arm, you would only be able to move your arm in one direction&#151;and you would not be able to move it back again.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Structure of a Muscle</span><br>
Remember from Concept 27.2 that skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles. Picking up a book, walking down the street, or performing any one of thousands of other conscious motions all require using skeletal muscles. For example, you use the muscles in your arm frequently throughout the day for activities as varied as writing notes during class and scratching an itch on your nose.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look, a skeletal muscle such as your calf muscle consists of bundles of parallel muscle fibers along with a supply of nerves and blood vessels (Figure 27-18). A <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmusclef.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmusclef.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">muscle fiber</a> is a single long cylindrical muscle cell that contains many nuclei. A large skeletal muscle contains hundreds of thousands of these cells.</p>

<p>Inside a muscle fiber are bundles of smaller units called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmyofibr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmyofibr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">myofibrils</a>. If you observe a myofibril under a microscope, you will see that it has alternating light and dark bands (shown as red and white stripes in Figure 27-18). For this reason, skeletal muscle is also known as <i>striated</i> muscle, which means "striped."</p>

<p>A single myofibril consists of repeating units called sarcomeres. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsarcome.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsarcome.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sarcomere</a> (SAHR koh mir) is the muscle fiber's basic unit of action&#151;it is the unit that contracts. Each sarcomere is composed of two kinds of filaments, thin and thick. The thin filaments are composed of the protein <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gactin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gactin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">actin</a> and have a twisted, ropelike structure. The thick filaments are composed of the protein <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmyosin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmyosin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">myosin</a> and have bumplike projections called myosin heads.</p>

<p>The interaction of myosin heads with the thin filaments is the key to muscle contraction. As with many other cell processes that you have read about, the energy-storage molecule ATP plays an important role in this process. In each mini-contraction (shown in Figure 27-18), myosin heads first bind to thin filaments. Next, the myosin heads bend, pulling the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. ATP then binds to each myosin head, releasing it from the thin filament. The myosin head is now free to attach at a new spot and further pull the thin filament along. Note that the filaments themselves don't get shorter, but as they slide across one another, their overlap increases. The sarcomere shortens. The process can continue until the sarcomere is fully contracted. As the sarcomeres of many muscle fibers shorten together, the entire muscle contracts.</p>

<p>Though only a few myosin heads are shown in Figure 27-18, a typical thick filament has about 350 myosin heads. Each head can bind and unbind to a thin filament about 5 times per second. The myosin heads do not all release from the thin filament at the same time&#151;if that were the case, the thin filament could slide back to its former position. Instead, some of the heads hold the thin filaments in position, while others release and connect to new binding sites. You can observe an animation of a contracting muscle as part of Online Activity 27.5.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Anatomy and Physiology of a Handshake</span><br>
A handshake may at first seem like such a simple task: You grab someone's hand and give it a squeeze. But physiologically, shaking someone's hand is a complicated procedure requiring many muscles, bones, and nerves working simultaneously and in coordination. You must extend your hand at precisely the right moment, in just the right position, and with the polite amount of grip.</p>

<p>All this coordination occurs in your brain, the main control center of your body. First, your eyes sense the presence of the other person and relay that information to your brain. The thinking part of your brain decides to initiate the handshake. Then other brain regions send out messages along your nerves to an array of muscles. The response consists of coordinated contractions and relaxations in the muscles of your back, shoulder, upper arm, forearm, and wrist. These muscles lift and extend the right bones in the right sequence to extend your hand. Finally, many muscles manipulate the 27 bones in your hand into place.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, blood cells travel through your blood vessels, providing a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen to hand muscles. The brain acts as the control center, directing each and every movement involved in the handshake through an extensive network of nerves. As this example shows, what may seem like a very simple gesture is in fact a complicated process that requires energy and involves the cooperation of many of your body's organs, tissues, and cells. In the chapters to come, you will learn the physiology behind other seemingly simple daily tasks.</p>
