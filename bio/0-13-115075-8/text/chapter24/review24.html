<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>8.</b> Identify two functions of an arthropod's exoskeleton.</p>
  
<p><b>9.</b> In which habitat did the first arthropods evolve? Describe two ways they differed from modern arthropods.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Describe the diet and defenses of a millipede.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Compare and contrast a spider and a beetle.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Give three examples of arachnids.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Give an example of a positive interaction and an example of a negative interaction between insects and humans.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>18.</b> Use the terms below to make lists of characteristics for each of three groups of arthropods: arachnids, crustaceans, and insects. You can use terms more than once.<p>

<p align="center"><img src="24images/24-cr-18.gif" width="250" height="159" alt="fill in table of Arthropod Characteristics"></p>

<p>tracheae, book lungs, spiracles, 
Malpighian tubules, ganglia, spinnerets, 
brain, wings, pedipalps, exoskeleton, cephalothorax, blood, carapace
</p>
		
<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>19. Analyzing Graphs</b> Use the pie chart showing the diversity of different groups of animals as percentages of the total number of animal species to answer the questions below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="24images/24-cr-19.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="pie chart of different groups of animals"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> What general conclusion about arthropods can you draw from this pie chart?<br>
<b>b.</b> Which arthropod group is most diverse?<br>
<b>c.</b> Name at least three groups that fall within the "Non-insect arthropod" category.<br>
<b>d.</b> Approximately what percentage of insects are butterflies and moths? Explain your calculation.</p>

<p><b>20. Analyzing Photos</b> The photo below shows a close-up of the coiled mouthpart of an arthropod. Use the photo to answer the questions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="24images/24-cr-20.jpg" width="185" height="235" alt="photo close-up of the coiled mouthpart of an arthropod"></p>

<b>a.</b> Is this arthropod most likely an arachnid, crustacean, or insect? Explain your choice.<br>
<b>b.</b> Does this arthropod most likely chew, lap, or suck its food? Explain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>  
<b>21. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Describe two features of an arthopod's structure and function that are similar to your own. Describe two features that are different.</p>

<p><b>22. Comparing and Contrasting</b> One key characteristic of arthropods is their jointed appendages. Contrast the functions of four different appendages found in four different arthropods.</p>

<p><b>23. Developing Hypotheses</b> Insects with complete metamorphosis are more diverse and numerous than insects with incomplete metamorphosis, and evolved more recently. Hypothesize how this adaptation may have provided advantages.</p>

<p><b>24. Evaluating the Impact of Research </b> How did the research of apple maggot fly behavior help entomologists develop a non-toxic way to manage this pest? List some advantages of this method.</p>

<p><b>25. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> A characteristic of all spiders is web-weaving.<br>
<b>b.</b> Insects are flying arthropods.<br>
<b>c.</b> Insects are pests.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Writing</b> Suppose you were able to eliminate all the insects from your schoolyard, community garden, or local park. Describe the changes that would happen as a result. Before you start writing, make a survey of insects at that location.</p>
