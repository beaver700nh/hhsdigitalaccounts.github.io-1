<p>Maybe you've watched ants crawl across the sidewalk, heard crickets chirping on a summer night, or seen a butterfly land on a flower. Insects seem to be everywhere, and there are so many different kinds! What are the keys to their success?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Insects</span><br>
Insects have three main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. They have three pairs of walking legs and usually one or two pairs of wings attached to the thorax. Insect wings are extensions of the exoskeleton of the thorax.</p>

<p>Like spiders, insects have Malpighian tubules that serve in excretion. But instead of book lungs, they have an extensive tracheal system that transports gases throughout the body. Like most crustaceans, insects typically have compound eyes, but they have just one pair of sensory antennae. One function of antennae is to detect chemical signals released by individuals of the same and different insect species. Those signals released by the same species are called pheromones (FER uh mohnz). For example, many male moths detect female pheromones, helping guide them to mates. In social species such as honeybees, some of the activities of the hive are coordinated by pheromones.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ability to Fly</span> Flight is one key to the great success of insects. Most species have wings in adulthood. An animal that has the ability to fly can escape many predators, find food and mates, and disperse to new habitats faster than an animal that is limited to walking or crawling around.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Diverse Feeding Habits</span> The ability of diverse insects to thrive in a variety of habitats is another key to their success. This is partly due to their diverse types of mouthparts. Some insects, including grasshoppers, use mandibles to handle, bite, and chew food such as leaves. Other insects have mouthparts that are fused together into a sucking tube. A mosquito uses this structure to pierce skin and suck blood. Some insects, such as fruit flies, lap their food. Many insects have a combination of feeding mouthparts, giving them access to various types of food. Furthermore, some insects have specialized digestive enzymes (or have microorganisms with such enzymes in their guts) that allow them to take advantage of some unusual food sources that other animals cannot, such as beeswax, wool, and wood.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Metamorphosis</span> During their development many insects undergo metamorphosis, a process in which their body form changes from the sexually immature to the mature stage. Once metamorphosis is complete, the adult no longer grows. Molting and metamorphosis are controlled by insect hormones. In some insects, the change from juvenile to adult is not very dramatic, and is called incomplete metamorphosis. For example, juvenile grasshoppers look like miniature adults, except that the proportions are a little different. The juveniles also lack wings and sexual organs. Changes in size occur at several molts during the juvenile stage. The final molt is the one that produces the adult stage.</p>

<p>But other insects, such as butterflies, flies, and beetles, have an adult stage that looks and functions very differently from the larva. These insects undergo what is called <i>complete metamorphosis</i>. Typically in these cases, the larval stage is specialized for eating and growing, and the adult is specialized for moving to a new location and reproducing. Complete metamorphosis may be part of the key to insect success in that it allows the insect to take advantage of more than one habitat and food source at different life stages.</p>

<p>The larva molts several times into larger and larger larval stages. During the transition between the larval and adult stages, an insect with complete metamorphosis becomes a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpupa.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpupa.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pupa</a> (PYOO puh). During the pupal stage, the insect larva stops feeding and becomes inactive. Major chemical and physical changes occur in the insect during this time of transformation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Insect Diversity</span><br>
There are more insect species than all the other animal species combined. They live in almost every habitat on land and in fresh water. They are rare only in the ocean, where crustaceans are the most common arthropods. You are probably already familiar with some if not all of the major orders of insects, at least by their common names (Figure 24-14).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Impact of Insects</span><br>
Animals so numerous, diverse, and widespread as insects are bound to affect the lives of many other organisms, including humans. On one hand, humans and other organisms depend on insects. Bees, beetles, and many other insects pollinate the majority of flowering plants, including crops and orchard trees. This allows plants to reproduce and bear fruit. Termites and ants break down organic matter, helping produce new soil and recycling nutrients.</p>

<p>On the other hand, certain insects are carriers of diseases that affect humans. For example, there has been recent concern in parts of the United States about mosquito-spread viruses, in particular West Nile virus. These viruses can cause encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (an inflammation of spinal cord tissues) in humans and other mammals. Insects also compete with humans for food. In parts of Africa, for instance, insects destroy about 75 percent of the crops.</p>

<p>There is an entire field of biology called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gentomol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gentomol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">entomology</a> devoted to classifying and understanding the biology of insects. The focus of some entomologists is on developing ways to control pest insects. The use of toxins (pesticides, or insecticides) has been the standard approach in the past. But many of these toxins had unexpected effects. Some, like DDT, were found to be deadly to other animals such as beneficial insects and birds. Additionally, resistance to toxins often evolves in insects through the process of natural selection, as you read in Chapter 14. As a result, farmers and public health officials have had to apply stronger doses or new combinations of toxins.</p>

<p>One challenge of entomologists today is to solve problems caused by pest insects without hurting beneficial insects and the rest of the environment. One solution is <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiologi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiologi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biological control</a>,  the control of pest organisms by interfering with their natural ecological interactions. For example, introducing ladybird beetles or wasps that naturally prey on pest insects can help keep pest populations in check. Other methods involve finding ways to expose a toxin to just the targeted pest insect and not other animals. Practices like these are used in a method of pest control called integrated pest management, or IPM. IPM relies on closely monitoring the presence of insect pests and their life cycles in order to prevent the use of unnecessary chemical controls. The strategy behind IPM is to use physical barriers, planting practices, or biological controls whenever possible as alternatives to traditional chemical pesticides. Another approach, which you read about in Chapter 13, is genetic engineering of plants to resist particular insects.</p>

<p>Still another control strategy is to manipulate the pest insect's behavior. For example, to defend against the apple maggot fly, some farmers hang a sticky red ball from the apple trees. Flies that would normally mate and lay eggs (that hatch into apple maggots) on real apples are lured to the exaggerated shape and color of the fakes. They get trapped on the sticky surface and die.</p>

<p>Some methods of pest insect control, especially of disease-carrying insects, rely on education campaigns. One role of public health officials is to warn people about dangerous insects and ways to avoid contact with them. For example, perhaps you have noticed campaigns in your neighborhood or city to clean up old tires and other sources of standing water. Simple measures such as these can help reduce mosquito populations.</p>

<p>Learning how to live with (or despite) insects is a necessity. As one entomologist has pointed out, insects are not going to inherit the Earth. They already own it!</p>
