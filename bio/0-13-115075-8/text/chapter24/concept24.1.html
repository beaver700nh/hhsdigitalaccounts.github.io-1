<p>Biologists have identified nearly 1 million arthropod species. All the other animal species combined number leass than one third as many. Arthropods thrive in almost every habitat on Earth, and their global population is estimated at 1 billion billion, or 10<span class="sub"><sup>18</sup></span> individuals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Arthropods</span><br>
<a href="../../glossary/terms/a/garthrop.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/garthrop.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Arthropods</a> are characterized by their segmented bodies, jointed appendages, and hard external skeletons. In contrast to annelids, which have similar segments throughout the body, arthropods have distinct groupings of segments. A dragonfly, for example, has three distinct groupings: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. The head consists of fused segments bearing sensory antennae (an TEN ee), eyes, and mouthparts (specialized appendages near the mouth). The middle section of fused segments bears legs and wings. This midsection of an arthropod is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthorax.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthorax.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">thorax</a>. Finally, the dragonfly's abdomen section bears reproductive appendages. An arthropod's appendages, the parts attached to its segments, are jointed. In fact, <a href="../../glossary/terms/j/gjointed.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/j/gjointed.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">jointed appendages</a> are the source of the name <i>arthropod</i> (Greek <i>arthron</i> for "joint," and <i>pod</i> for "foot"). </p>

<p>The arthropod body, including the appendages, is covered by a hard external skeleton, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gexoskel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gexoskel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">exoskeleton</a>. The exoskeleton of arthropods contrast with the endoskeletons of some other animal phyla. An endoskeleton, such as your own, is <i>inside</i> the body instead of on the surface. Your endoskeleton grows continuously along with the rest of your body, whereas an exoskeleton cannot. The exoskeleton consists of layers of proteins mixed with a polysaccharide called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchitin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchitin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chitin</a> (KY tun). It is waterproofed by lipids. The exoskeleton protects the arthropod. Knobs on the inner surface of the exoskeleton provide points of attachment for muscles that move the appendages.</p>

<p>As it grows, an arthropod must periodically shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a larger one, a process called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmolting.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmolting.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">molting</a>. Before molting, the arthropod secretes a new layer of chitin beneath its exoskeleton, then forces fluid between the old and new exoskeletons. The outer exoskeleton splits open and the arthropod crawls out. At first, the new exoskeleton is quite soft, but it hardens over time. Just after molting, the "soft" arthropod is especially vulnerable to predators and other dangers.</p>

<p>Arthropods show a great variety of adaptations in their body systems. But there are some features that all arthropods share (Figure 24-3). Arthropods have an open circulatory system, in which blood is pumped through a tube-like heart into chambers that bathe the organs. The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord and brain. All along the nerve cord are clusters of nerve cell bodies called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gganglia.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gganglia.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ganglia</a> (GANG glee uh). Optic nerves leading from the eyes transmit visual information to the brain. Most arthropods have <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcompeye.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcompeye.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">compound eyes</a> with many facets, each with its own lens. However some arthropods, such as most spiders, have camera-like, single-lens eyes. And there are arthropods that have both single-lens and compound eyes.</p>

<p>Aquatic arthropods have gills that function in respiration (the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the surrounding environment). Most terrestrial arthropods have <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tracheae</a> (TRAY kee ee), chitin-lined tubes that lead from the internal parts of the body to the outside. Tracheae (singular, <i>trachea</i>) allow the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen through holes in the exoskeleton called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gspiracl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gspiracl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">spiracles</a>.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">An Overview of Arthropod Diversity</span><br>
Fossil evidence indicates that the first arthropods evolved in the sea about 560 million years ago. These early arthropods had more body segments and less specialization of those segments than most modern arthropods. Examples of early arthropods, now extinct, are the trilobites. Paleontologists have described about 4,000 trilobite species. Because of their hard exoskeleton, trilobites and other early arthropods have left an excellent fossil record.</p>

<p>A group of spiderlike arthropods was abundant in the sea about 300 million years ago. Today only four species of this ancient group still exist, the horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs have changed very little during their long existence on Earth. North America has just one species, which gathers on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States in groups of thousands to spawn&#151;to release eggs and sperm. The females release eggs at the ocean's edge. Many of the eggs become an essential food source for other animals. For example, many migrating shorebirds "refuel" for the next leg of their long flights by feeding on these eggs.</p>

<p>One other group of arthropods in existence today lives mostly in aquatic environments: the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcrustac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcrustac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">crustaceans</a>. This group includes lobsters, crabs, crayfish, shrimp, and barnacles, among others. The fiddler crab is one example of a modern aquatic arthropod. Note the specialization of its appendages. For instance, male fiddler crabs have one claw that is larger than the other. By waving the large claw back and forth, the male signals to mates and rivals. </p>

<p>The majority of arthropods have adapted to living on land. The move onto land was made possible in part by the exoskeleton, which prevents water loss and provides structural support. Today, the terrestrial arthropods include three groups: the arachnids, the insects, and the myriapods, or many-legged arthropods. <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/garachni.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/garachni.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Arachnids</a> include spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks. <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginsect.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginsect.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Insects</a> include beetles, ants, grasshoppers, butterflies, dragonflies, and many others. The myriapods include the centipedes and millipedes.</p>

<p>Centipedes and millipedes live in humid environments, and can be found in soil, in leaf litter, or under stones and wood. Compared with insects, they have many more pairs of legs. In centipedes, each body segment behind the head bears a single pair of long legs. The head includes a pair of claws that secrete a poison used to stun or kill prey. Millipedes have two pairs of legs per segment and eat dead and decaying plant material. They defend themselves by curling up into a ball, and some species secrete a foul-smelling or toxic chemical when threatened.</p>

<p>In the next three concepts, you will explore in more detail the diversity, anatomy, and lifestyles of the largest groups of arthropods: the arachnids, crustaceans, and insects.</p>
