<p>Through the night, the spider waits in the dark on its silk web. At daybreak, the web gently sways in a breeze. Finally, breakfast arrives. A fly has flown into the web. Silk webs are just one of many interesting ways arachnids obtain meals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Arachnids</span><br>
Scorpions, spiders, ticks, and mites and several smaller groups are collectively called arachnids. Arachnids have two body sections and four pairs of legs (Figure 24-7). The two body sections are a fused head and thorax, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcephtho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcephtho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cephalothorax</a> (sef ul loh THAWR aks), and an abdomen. Arachnids have two pairs of mouthparts. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchelice.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchelice.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Chelicerae</a> (kuh LIS ur ee) are fanglike mouthparts used to paralyze prey with poison. <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpedipal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpedipal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Pedipalps</a> are mouthparts typically used to manipulate prey once it has been paralyzed.</p>

<p>Almost all arachnids live on land and have several adaptations that help them retain water. In addition to their water-tight exoskeleton, arachnids have excretory structures called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmalpigh.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmalpigh.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Malpighian tubules</a> (mal PIG ee un) that remove wastes from the fluid in the body cavity. These tubules also work with the gut in reducing water loss by reabsorbing most water before wastes leave the body. Many arachnids also have specialized respiratory structures called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbooklun.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbooklun.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">book lungs</a>. Book lungs contain many flaps of tissue, like the sheets of a book, that provide a large surface area for gas exchange. They exchange gases with the atmosphere through an opening in the exoskeleton. Some arachnids transport respiratory gases through tracheae in addition to or instead of book lungs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Arachnids</span><br>
As you get to know the arachnids, you'll learn that they encompass a great variety of species in many habitats. Spiders, scorpions, and mites and ticks are examples of arachnid subgroups.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Spiders</span> Generally, spiders are characterized as hunters or weavers. Hunters include tarantulas and wolf spiders that roam the ground, searching for prey. The weavers, on the other hand, are "sit-and-wait" predators. They catch prey in a web that they weave, using silk proteins produced by silk glands inside the abdomen. The silk is spun into fibers by organs near the end of the abdomen called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gspinner.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gspinner.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">spinnerets</a>.</p>

<p>Although not all spiders weave webs, all produce silk. Spiders may use silk to wrap prey in tight bundles for storage. Many baby spiders eject a small line of silk that catches the wind and carries them to new locations. Some hunting spiders use silk as a covering for their underground burrows. A variety of other uses for silk have been observed.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Scorpions</span> Scorpions are nighttime hunters that mainly live in deserts. Their pedipalps are modified as pincers that function in defense and capturing prey. The tip of the tail bears a poisonous stinger. Scorpions eat mainly insects and spiders. They will attack people only when prodded or stepped on. Only a few species of scorpions are dangerous to humans. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mites and Ticks</span> Mites and ticks are small, often microscopic arachnids. Many are parasites that suck sap from plants or blood from mammals, but most are free-living. Mites and ticks with sucking mouthparts often have needlelike chelicerae and pedipalps equipped with claws for holding onto the host. Some ticks, notably the deer tick, can transmit serious diseases to humans, including Lyme disease.</p>
