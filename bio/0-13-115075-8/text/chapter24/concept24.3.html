<p>A whale hurtles toward the ocean surface, her huge mouth gaping open. After breaking the surface, her jaws clamp down. While water pours back out through the slits in sieve-like plates lining her mouth, thousands of tiny crustaceans called krill are trapped. As prey, many crustaceans support populations of animals much larger than themselves.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Decapods</span><br>
Of all the crustaceans, you are probably most familiar with the decapods (meaning "ten legs"). Their common names include lobster, crab, and shrimp. The "ten legs" refer to the pair of pincers (claws) and four pairs of walking legs that are characteristic of most decapods. While most decapods are marine, crayfish live in fresh water, and a few tropical crabs live on land.</p>

<p>Like arachnids, decapods have two main body regions: a cephalothorax and abdomen. A decapod's exoskeleton is harder than that of many arthropods because it is reinforced with calcium carbonate (limestone). The portion of the exoskeleton that covers the back of the cephalothorax forms a shield called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcarapac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcarapac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">carapace</a>. Decapods and other crustaceans have two pairs of sensory antennae attached to the head. The mouthparts closest to the mouth are hard <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmandibl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmandibl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">mandibles</a>, which bite and grind food.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Barnacles, Copepods, and Isopods</span><br>
Barnacles are marine crustaceans that secrete calcium carbonate shells in which they live. Perhaps you have seen them covering rocks at the seashore. They also grow on wooden piers, ships' hulls, and even on the skin of whales. During low tide a barnacle is sealed tightly in its shell, protected from drying out. During high tide, when covered with water, its jointed, feathery appendages poke out from the shell and beat back and forth. The jointed appendages sweep small invertebrates and organic particles toward the mouthparts inside the shell. Barnacle larvae disperse on ocean currents and settle on rocks and other surfaces that are sometimes hundreds of kilometers from their parents.</p>

<p>Copepods are very small, but like the krill you read about at the beginning of the concept, they play a big role in the food chains of marine and freshwater communities. A copepod is typically under 2 mm long. They feed on photosynthetic bacteria and phytoplankton, and in turn are fed upon by larger animals. Copepods are one of the main food sources for younger stages of many commercially important fishes, such as cod.</p>

<p>Most isopods are small marine crustaceans. Some species are numerous at the bottom of deep oceans. Isopods also include the familiar land-dwelling pill bugs, sometimes called wood lice, which you may have seen underneath wet leaves or a rotting log. Like millipedes, pill bugs curl into a ball when threatened.</p>
