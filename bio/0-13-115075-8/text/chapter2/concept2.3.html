       <p>What you learn this year about biology and the process of science will help you evaluate many issues that affect your personal life, such as health issues. Your understanding of science will also help 

you make decisions

         that affect your community and even the entire nation. In 

just a few years

         you may be voting in local, state, and national elections. 

Democracy works

         best when voters understand the issues. And science now 

impacts many issues

         that voters face. This section explores some of the things you need to

         know.</p>
       <p><span class="setextsub">Evidence in Science</span><br>

         Unconfirmed observations filling supermarket tabloids would 

have you believe

         that some of your classmates are aliens from space and that humans are

         occasionally born with the heads of dogs. Most people, 

especially if they

         understand science, do not find the eyewitness accounts and 

computer-rigged

         photos to be convincing evidence. But judgments are harder 

when you read,

         for example, a magazine ad for a food supplement. You might 

find testimonials

         from enthusiastic users, graphs, quotes from &quot;experts,&quot; and

         so on. To avoid wasting money and endangering your health, you need to

         know how to judge the quality of the evidence.</p>

       <p><i>Evidence</i> is a word that comes up as often in science as it does

         in courtrooms. In general, evidence is the information upon 

which inferences

         are based. In science, <a 

href="../../glossary/terms/e/gevidenc.html" target="glossterm" 

onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gevidenc.html');return 

false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">evidence</a>

         consists of a collected body of data from observations and experiments.

         And such evidence doesn't begin to convince scientists until 

the observations

         and experiments have been repeated multiple times with similar results.

         The scientists who studied snake mimicry in the Carolinas 

obtained similar

         data when they repeated their experiments with different 

species of coral

         snakes and kingsnakes in Arizona. And you should be able to 

obtain similar

         data if you were to repeat the snake experiment. Such 

attempts to repeat

         independently the observations and experiments of others are common in

         science. Repeatability is a hallmark of scientific evidence.</p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">What Makes a Hypothesis Scientific?</span><br>

         Magazines and television programs have no shortage of hypotheses that

         are claimed to be scientific. But how do you know which of 

the hypotheses

         make scientific sense? Look at whether the hypothesis can be 

tested (and

         if it has been). In science, the only hypotheses that count are those

         that meet this standard of testability. You saw this process at work in

         both the flashlight and snake examples. Each hypothesis led 

to a prediction

         that could be tested in an experiment. And notice that the experiments

         could either support or contradict the hypotheses. The 

flashlight experiment

         could show that the hypothesis of dead batteries was 

incorrect. And though

         the experiments with artificial snakes supported the mimicry 

hypothesis,

         the data could have gone the other way. Suppose both groups of snakes

         had been attacked equally. Such results would have cast doubt 

on the hypothesis

         that the mimic coloration helped discourage predators. In contrast, try

         to think of a way to test the hypothesis that invisible "space aliens"

         were fooling with your flashlight. How could you show that such an idea

         is false? A scientific hypothesis must be <i>falsifiable</i>&#151;that is, there must be some observation or experiment that 

<i>could</i> reveal

         if such a hypothesis is false.</p>

       <p>Scientists test a hypothesis many times and in different 

ways. Even hypotheses

         that stand up to repeated testing may later be revised or 

even rejected.

         One way such change occurs is when new research tools make new kinds of

         observations and experiments possible. A few decades ago, for example,

         most biologists accepted the hypothesis that fungi are closely related

         to plants. The evidence included some similarities in structure, growth

         pattern, and reproduction. That hypothesis has been challenged by new

         methods that make it possible to analyze and compare the DNA of diverse

         organisms. </p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">The Limitations of Science</span><br>

         Science is powerful, but limited in the kinds of questions it can help

         answer. Science requires repeatable observations and testable 

hypotheses.

         These standards restrict science to a search for <i>natural</i> causes

         for natural phenomena. For example, science can neither prove 

nor disprove

         that unobservable or supernatural forces cause storms, 

rainbows, illnesses,

         or cures of disease. Supernatural explanations of natural 

events are simply

         outside the bounds of science. There is no way to show that 

such hypotheses

         are false.</p>

       <p>Although science is "a way of knowing," keep in mind that it 

is not the

         <i>only</i> way. Not everything you "know" is based on 

science. For example,

         you <i>know</i> what kind of music you like and what your 

favorite color

         is. These personal tastes are not the results of a careful testing of

         hypotheses. And you <i>know</i> right from wrong. This 

concept is an ethical

         value, not a scientific fact. Each human mind develops a 

unique database

         of knowledge of many different kinds. Science-based knowledge 

is the type

         built from confirmed observations and testable hypotheses. </p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">Theories in Science</span><br>

         Many people think of science mainly as a collection of facts. 

But collecting

         facts is not what really defines science. A telephone book is 

an impressive

         catalog of factual information, yet it has little to do with science.

         It is true that factual data provide the raw material for science. But

         scientists are mostly interested in finding patterns in the 

data and explaining

         these patterns. What really advances science is some new 

theory that ties

         together a variety of facts that previously seemed unrelated. 

People like

         Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Albert Einstein stand out 

in the history

         of science because their theories connected so many 

observations and experimental

         results.</p>

       <p>How is a theory different from a hypothesis? In science, a 

<a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtheory.html" target="glossterm" 

onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtheory.html');return 

false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">theory</a>

         is a well-tested explanation that makes sense of a great 

variety of scientific

         observations. It gives rise to many hypotheses that can be tested. This

         definition contrasts with the everyday use of <i>theory</i> to mean a

         speculation, as in "It's only a theory." Compared to a 

hypothesis, a theory

         is much broader in scope. <i>This</i> is a hypothesis: 

"Mimicking poisonous

         snakes is an adaptation that protects nonpoisonous snakes 

from predators."

         But <i>this</i> is a theory: "Adaptations such as mimicry 

evolve by natural

         selection." The theory of natural selection explains the evolution of

         the many cases of mimicry, as well as a variety of other adaptations of

         organisms to their environments. </p>

       <p>Theories, such as the theory of natural selection, only become widely

         accepted in science when they are supported by an extensive 

body of evidence.

         That evidence also provides a framework for further research 

and predictions.

         If new evidence that contradicts a theory is uncovered, 

scientists first

         verify the evidence many times. They then modify or discard the theory

         accordingly.</p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">Models</span><br>

         Have you ever drawn a simple map for a friend who needed directions to

         your home? If so, you created a model. <a 

href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmodel.html" target="glossterm" 

onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmodel.html');return 

false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Models</a>

         are physical, mental, or mathematical representations of how 

people understand

         a process or an idea. Models can be very useful tools of 

scientific thinking.

         A model can take the form of a drawing, graph, 

three-dimensional object,

         computer program, or mathematical equation. Even a description in words

         of how a natural process works is a model. The diagrams in Figure 2-20

         are two different models that represent blood flow through 

the human heart.

         You can tell that the pictures are not images of a real heart. Models

         are not exact replicas of something real. Rather, they are 

useful because

         they help people explain and evaluate ideas about the natural 

world.</p>

             Though neither of these diagrams looks realistic, both can help you

             understand a key process in the body. The model on the left 

simply shows the

             path of blood flow into and out of the heart's four chambers. The

             model on the right shows more detail about the connecting blood vessels.

             (The models are "face-on" views, with the "right" and "left" labels

             referring to the person's right and left sides.) Red 

indicates blood that is rich in oxygen; blue represents oxygen-depleted 

blood.</span></td>

         </tr>

       </table>

       </p>

       

       <p>Analogies are another type of model in science. An analogy 

is a comparison

         that shows a likeness between two things. For example, you 

might say the

         brain is like a computer. Analogies are valuable aids to 

memory and creative

         thinking because they usually compare something that you are 

just starting

         to understand with something that you know from everyday life.</p>

       <p>Scientists judge the value of a model several ways. Does it 

explain all

         the observations related to it? Can predictions be made from the model?

         Is it compatible with other, related models or ideas? For example, does

         the description of blood flow in the diagram in Figure 2-20 match the

         path blood actually follows in a working heart? Can this model be used

         as a basis for designing a plan for an artifical heart? A 

model that explains,

         predicts, or matches new observations becomes increasingly 

useful to scientists.

         And, models that fail to meet these requirements don't last.</p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">Communication in Science</span><br>

         Cartoons and movies sometimes portray scientists as loners working in

         isolated laboratories. In reality, science is an intensely 

social activity.

         Most scientists work in teams, and most successful scientists are good

         communicators. Researchers share their findings by publishing articles

         in journals and by giving talks or presenting posters at meetings. The

         Internet has become an increasingly important way for 

scientists to exchange

         ideas and data with colleagues all over the world. It also allows the

         general public easy access to the work of many scientists. As 

you conduct

         biological research this year, you'll have a chance to share 

some of your

         ideas and data via the <i>Biology: Exploring Life</i> Web site.</p>

       <p>Both cooperation and competition characterize the scientific culture.

         Scientists working in the same research field often check one another's

         claims by attempting to repeat experiments. Sometimes, science provides

         all the excitement of a race. Most scientists enjoy the 

challenge to "get

         there first" with an important discovery or key experiment.</p>

       <p><span class="setextsub">Science, Technology, and Society</span><br>

         The strong link between science and society becomes even clearer when

         you add technology to the picture. Science and technology are related,

         but their goals and methods are different. The goal of 

science is to understand

         nature through careful observation and testing of hypotheses. The goal

         of <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtechnol.html" 

target="glossterm" 

onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtechnol.html');return 

false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">technology</a>

         is to apply scientific understanding for some specific 

purpose. Scientists&#151;such

         as biologists&#151;speak of "discoveries." On the other hand, 

technologists&#151;such

         as engineers&#151;speak of "inventions."</p>

       <p>Fifty years ago, scientists James Watson and Francis Crick discovered

         the structure of DNA, the chemical material of genes. Their discovery

         eventually led to a variety of DNA technologies. An example 

is the genetic

         engineering that pharmaceutical companies are now using to 

produce a new

         generation of medicines. Perhaps Watson and Crick wondered if 

their discovery

         would someday have important applications, but they probably 

did not predict

         exactly what those applications would be.</p>

       <p>The direction technology takes depends less on the curiosity 

that drives

         basic science than it does on the current needs and wants of humans and

         on the social environment of the times. An example of how society makes

         choices about technology is the issue of whether people 

should be tested

         to see if they have genes for heritable diseases. Should such tests be

         voluntary or required? Should insurance companies or 

employers have access

         to the information? How should people who learn that they carry genetic

         diseases make decisions about whether to have children? Who 

should decide

         the answers to these questions? Such hotly debated issues 

about technology

         often are not about "<i>can</i> it be done," but "<i>should</i> it be

         done." Such issues make front-page news. Technology and the science on

         which it depends cannot be separated from the society in 

which they occur.

         More than ever, good citizens must make an effort to gain a 

basic understanding

         of science and technology. Whether you are making lifestyle 

choices that

         affect your health or democratic choices that affect the 

future of society,

         your understanding of biology and the process of science should serve

         you well.</p>
