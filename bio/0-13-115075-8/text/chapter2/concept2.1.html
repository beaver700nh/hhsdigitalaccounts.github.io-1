<p>Any science textbook, including this one, is packed with information based on what scientists have discovered in the past. Indeed, science has built an impressive body of knowledge that continues to increase and change with new discoveries. Much of what's known is fascinating, but the real fun in science begins when you turn from what's <i>known</i> to what's <i>unknown</i>.</p> 

<p>Biology blends two main forms of scientific exploration: discovery science and hypothesis-based science. Discovery science, as you'll read later in this section, is mostly about <i>describing</i> nature. Hypothesis-based science, as you'll read in Concept 2.2, is mostly about <i>explaining</i> nature. Most scientists practice a combination of these two approaches.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Science as Inquiry</span><br>
Biology is defined as the scientific study of life. But what does <i>scientific</i> mean? What is science? The word is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to know." In other words, science is a way of knowing. It is a way to answer questions about the natural world.</p> 

<p>At the heart of science is inquiry&#151;people asking questions about what they observe in nature and actively seeking answers. For example, have you ever noticed that most houseplants grow toward a light source, such as a window? Rotate the plant, and its direction of growth will shift until the leaves again face the window. Such observations inspire questions. How does the plant sense the direction of light? What enables the plant to bend toward light as it grows? In what direction would a plant grow in the dark?</p>

<p>Your own curiosity is the starting point for exploring life through inquiry. But inquiry means more than asking questions. Inquiry is a process of investigation, with thoughtful questions leading to a search for answers. Asking questions is a natural activity for all curious minds, but even figuring out what to ask takes practice. You can develop this and other skills that support scientific inquiry through the activities on the <i>Biology: Exploring Life</i> Web site and through your laboratory investigations. By the end of this school year, you'll have plenty of experience with science as a process of inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Observations and Data</span><br>
The questions that drive scientific inquiry are based on observations. In science, <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gobserva.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gobserva.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">observation</a> is the use of the senses&#151;such as vision or hearing&#151;to gather and record information about structures or processes. Recorded observations are called data. Put another way, <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdata.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdata.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">data</a> are items of information. For example, the penciled marks along a doorframe that track a child's height at different ages are biological data (Figure 2-2).</p>

<p>All observations depend on human senses. But, without help the senses are too limited to penetrate some of the most interesting realms of nature. Scientific instruments vastly increase the range of possible observations. In astronomy, telescopes reveal craters on the moon. In biology, microscopes make it possible to observe life that is invisible to the unaided eye. Other equipment enables humans to observe DNA and other molecules.</p>

<p>Observations are often recorded as measurements, also called <i>quantitative</i> data. Scientists worldwide use an international system of measurements based on the metric system. (See the Skills Activity Making Measurements.)</p> 

<p>Data also may be <i>qualitative</i>&#151;that is, in the form of descriptions instead of measurements. For example, Jane Goodall spent decades recording her observations of chimpanzee behavior in a jungle in Gambia, an east African nation. In addition to keeping careful notes as data in her field notebooks, Goodall also documented her observations with photographs and movies. Data can best support science when they are clearly organized, consistently recorded, and reliable.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">What Is Discovery Science?</span><br>
Jane Goodall's research on chimpanzees is an example of discovery science (also called descriptive science). Discovery science describes natural structures or processes as accurately as possible through careful observation and data collection. For example, students taking part in a research project to collect and identify organisms in a river represent discovery science in action. When a biologist uses a microscope to describe the arrangement of cells in the interior of a leaf, that's discovery science, too. In 2000, an international team of scientists announced that they had completed a detailed chemical "map" of human DNA. Their achievement is discovery science at the molecular level.</p>

<p>In contrast to the carefully planned mapping of human DNA, observant people sometimes discover something important about nature entirely by accident. One famous example is Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery that certain fungi produce chemicals that kill bacteria. Fleming, a Scottish physician, was culturing (growing) bacteria for research in his laboratory. He found that a mold (a type of fungus) had contaminated some of his cultures of bacteria. As he was discarding the "spoiled" cultures, Fleming noticed that no bacteria were growing near the mold. The fungus turned out to be <i>Penicillium</i>, a common mold. It produces an antibacterial substance that was later named penicillin. Fleming's accidental discovery revolutionized medicine. Penicillin proved to be just one of many lifesaving antibiotics that are made by fungi and other organisms. These drugs help treat strep throat, bacterial pneumonia, syphilis, and many other diseases caused by bacteria. The use of antibiotics has greatly extended the average human lifespan in many countries.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Inferences in Science</span><br> 
A logical conclusion based on observations is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginferen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginferen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">inference</a>. Often, a person makes an inference by relating observations to his or her prior knowledge. For instance, you infer someone is at the door when you hear the doorbell ring because you know the same thing has happened before. Examine the picnic table in Figure 2-6 on page 27 of your textbook. What can you infer from the place settings and other objects you observe on the table? Can you infer anything from what is <i>absent</i>? Can you make reasonable inferences about the weather and time of day when this photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Inferences are important in science because they help refine general questions into specific questions that can be explored further. For example, a scientist might ask: "What substance produced by this particular mold kills bacteria?" However, keep in mind that scientists are skeptical of inferences that "stretch" far beyond the data. An example would be inferring, <i>solely</i> from Fleming's observation, that some molds could be used to produce antibiotics capable of curing bacterial diseases in humans. It took much more research before this conclusion was accepted among scientists. Also, it is important not to confuse inferences with the observations on which they are based. Hearing the doorbell ring is an observation. Inferring that someone is at the door, though reasonable, has less certainty. Maybe an electrical short circuit is causing the bell to ring.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Generalizations in Discovery Science</span><br>
Carefully recorded observations provide "raw data" for science. However, some of the biggest breakthroughs in discovery science come when scientists put together many specific observations to reach a general conclusion, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneral.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneral.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">generalization</a>. For instance, in the 1800s, scientists used microscopes to examine bits of tissue from a diversity of organisms. In both plants and animals, the scientists observed the tiny units called cells in all of the specimens they studied. Cells were actually discovered in the 1600s in oak bark. But it was the accumulation of observations of cells in all organisms examined that finally gave biologists confidence that they had uncovered a general feature of life. This generalization that "all living things are made of cells" became part of what is known as the cell theory, one of the most important products of discovery science in the nineteenth century.</i> 

<p>It is also sometimes possible to generalize from quantitative data. This usually requires pooling (combining) measurements from a very large sample. To look for general patterns in measurements, it often helps to put the data in a graph. For example, the graph in Figure 2-8 compares the changes in heights of teenage boys and girls over time. Each point on the graph is an average measurement for many thousand boys or girls. The graph makes it easier to spot the general pattern that girls, <i>on average</i>, stop growing at a younger age than boys. Of course, there are many individual exceptions. <i>Some</i> females do continue to grow well past the average age when males stop growing. But the generalization still holds across the very large sample of teens.</p>

<p>Observations, data, inferences, and generalizations all advance people's understanding of life. But these processes of discovery science are often just the beginning of a scientific inquiry. For example, trees do not grow above a certain altitude in several mountain ranges. Observations of this "treeline" phenomenon in many mountain ranges in Western North America may lead you to a generalization: At a particular latitude, trees don't generally grow above a certain altitude. And you might go on to infer that environmental conditions at high altitude are unfavorable to tree growth. But which environmental factors influence tree growth most? Low temperatures? "Thin" atmosphere? Strong winds? Lack of soil? Or is it some combination of such factors that limit tree growth? Discovering something interesting inspires curious minds to seek an explanation. And that's when hypothesis-based science comes into play.</p>
