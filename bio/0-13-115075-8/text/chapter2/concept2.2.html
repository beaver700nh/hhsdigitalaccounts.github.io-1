      <p>It is one thing to describe and measure the growth of a plant toward 
        light (discovery science). But what causes this phenomenon? How can scientists 
        explain the plant's ability to detect and respond to the direction of 
        light? Such questions about causes and explanations are at the center 
        of hypothesis-based science.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Methods of Hypothesis-Based Science</span><br>
        You may have heard of "the scientific method." The steps of this idealized 
        method are diagrammed in Figure 2-10. At one time or another in their 
        research, scientists may use all or most of these steps. Often, however, 
        the sequence of steps does not exactly match the generalized scheme of 
        Figure 2-10. For example, a scientist may start to plan an experiment, 
        but then decide that more observations are needed first. In other cases, 
        observations are too puzzling to even suggest key questions until other 
        lines of research bring more understanding. Or, at some point in a research 
        project, scientists may realize they have been "barking up the wrong tree." 
        That is, they've been asking the wrong questions. Many scientific inquiries 
        are abandoned before any questions are answered, though the data from 
        observations and experiments may prove useful later. And accidental discoveries, 
        such as Fleming's findings about mold and bacteria, are certainly not 
        products of a rigid, step-by-step scientific method. Science is actually 
        less structured than most people realize.</p>

      <p>Despite all the variation in scientific inquiry, one key element is common 
        to all hypothesis-based science. In fact, this form of inquiry is named 
        for this key element: the hypothesis.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Forming and Testing a Hypothesis</span><br>
        A <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghypothe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghypothe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hypothesis</a> 
        (plural, <i>hypotheses</i>) is a suggested answer to a well-defined scientific 
        question&#151;an explanation on trial. Most hypotheses are concerned with 
        the causes of natural phenomena, such as the growth of a plant toward 
        light. A hypothesis is often based on past experience or knowledge gained 
        from discovery science or other sources. </p>
      <p>People use hypotheses almost instinctively, as a natural way to solve 
        everyday problems. For example, suppose your flashlight stops working 
        during a camping trip. That's an observation. The question is obvious: 
        Why doesn't the flashlight work? A reasonable hypothesis based on past 
        experience is that the batteries in the flashlight are dead.</p>
      <p>Scientists don't just <i>propose</i> hypotheses. They <i>test</i> these 
        ideas by making additional observations or by designing experiments. A 
        hypothesis allows you to make certain predictions. It is these predictions 
        that scientists then test. Consider the case of the failed flashlight 
        in Figure 2-11. Note that the prediction is written as an "<i>If</i> 
        . . . , <i>then</i> . . ." statement. <i>If</i> a particular hypothesis 
        is correct, and you test that hypothesis with a suitable experiment, <i>then</i> 
        you should expect a certain result for the experiment.</p>

      <p>What if the flashlight still doesn't work after changing the batteries? 
        Here's where things get interesting. Keep in mind that in science, an 
        incorrect hypothesis doesn't mean failure. It just means the hypothesis 
        that led to the prediction was probably wrong. The inquiry continues with 
        tests of alternative hypotheses. What would be your next step in the flashlight 
        problem? Perhaps, you could test another hypothesis by replacing the flashlight's 
        bulb.</p>
      <p>Even when experiments support a hypothesis, curiosity can send you in 
        new directions. (How long do batteries last in a flashlight? Do some brands 
        of batteries last longer than others?) Opportunities for creativity and 
        new challenges make scientific inquiry as exciting as exploring a new 
        landscape. As you reach the top of a hill or round the corner of a trail, 
        you may become curious to see the view from the next hill or around the 
        next corner. Science generates new questions in a similar manner.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">A Case Study of Hypothesis-Based Science</span><br>
        One way to learn more about how hypothesis-based science works is to examine 
        a case study. In contrast to a made-up example, such as the flashlight 
        problem, a case study is an in-depth examination of something that actually 
        happened. For instance, students in law school train to become lawyers 
        by analyzing the actual documents of past legal cases. Similarly, a case 
        study of a research project that was published in a scientific journal 
        will boost your understanding of how scientists go about their work. The 
        rest of this section is a case study of an inquiry about what harmless 
        snakes might gain by imitating poisonous ones. </p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">From Observations to Question and Hypothesis</span> 
        The story begins with some key observations. (Do you recognize this step 
        as discovery science?) Many poisonous animals are brightly colored, with 
        distinctive patterns in some species. This appearance is called warning 
        coloration because it marks the animal as dangerous to potential predators. 
        But there are also mimics. These imposters look like a poisonous species 
        but are really harmless to predators. For example, a non-stinging insect 
        called the flower fly is very similar in appearance to a stinging honeybee. 
        The question that follows from these observations is: What is the function 
        of such mimicry? </p>
      <p>In 2001, a team of biologists designed a simple but clever set of experiments 
        to test a hypothesis that was first suggested over a century earlier. 
        Here's the hypothesis: Mimics (such as the flower fly) benefit because 
        predators confuse them with the actual harmful species. Researchers David 
        and Karin Pfennig, along with one of their college students, tested this 
        hypothesis by studying mimicry in snakes that live in North and South 
        Carolina. A poisonous snake called the eastern coral snake is marked by 
        rings of red, yellow, and black. Predators rarely attack these snakes. 
        A nonpoisonous snake named the scarlet kingsnake mimics the ringed coloration 
        of the coral snake.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Testing a Prediction of the Hypothesis</span> 
        What is the explanation for this case of look-alike snakes? According 
        to the mimicry hypothesis, the coral-snakelike appearance of kingsnakes 
        repels predators. The hypothesis predicts that predators will attack snakes 
        with the bright rings of red, yellow, and black less frequently than they 
        will attack snakes lacking such warning coloration. To test this prediction, 
        the researchers made hundreds of artificial kingsnakes out of wire and 
        a claylike substance called plasticine. There were two types of artificial 
        snakes: those with the red, yellow, and black ring pattern of coral snakes; 
        and snakes with plain brown coloration.</p>
      <p>The researchers placed equal numbers of the two types of artificial snakes 
        in various sites throughout North and South Carolina. After four weeks, 
        the team retrieved the artificial snakes and counted how many had been 
        attacked by looking for bite or claw marks. The most common predators 
        were foxes, coyotes, and raccoons, but black bears also attacked some 
        of the artificial snakes.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Designing a Controlled Experiment</span> Why 
        did the experiment include artificial snakes that were plain brown along 
        with the ringed snakes? A quick answer is that the contrast in coloration 
        was necessary to see if predators attack snakes based on their color. 
        If all the snakes were the same, the number of attacks would indicate 
        nothing at all about the effect of the colored rings. This point illustrates 
        an important requirement for designing experiments that test hypotheses. 
        If you want to test the effect of one condition, you need to provide a 
        contrasting condition as well. A condition that can differ within the 
        experiment is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvariabl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvariabl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">variable</a>. 
        In the artificial snakes, the variable is the presence versus the absence 
        of the colored rings. Most often, experiments test the effect of a difference 
        in just one variable. An experiment that tests the effect of a single 
        variable is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcontrol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcontrol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">controlled 
        experiment</a>.</p>
      <p>By conducting a controlled experiment, scientists try to eliminate (control) 
        other variables that could affect the outcome. This is not usually a simple 
        task. For example, variables such as temperature or other weather conditions 
        could influence the activities of predators in the snake experiment. In 
        an ideal setting&#151;such as a laboratory&#151;scientists can keep temperature 
        and other environmental conditions as constant as possible. But such control 
        is usually impossible in a field experiment. And even in a laboratory, 
        total regulation of all but one variable is often not practical.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Eliminating Unwanted Variables</span> What 
        is the solution to the problem of unwanted variables? Researchers divide 
        the subjects (the artificial snakes, for example) into two groups: a control 
        group and an experimental group. Since the snake experiment was designed 
        to test the effect of the colored rings, the artificial snakes with the 
        colored rings were the experimental group. The brown snakes served as 
        a control group by showing what happens in the absence of colored rings. 
        Everything else about the two snake groups was the same. For example, 
        both ringed snakes and brown snakes were made of the same materials. Both 
        kinds of snakes were placed at random in the same locations. Conditions 
        such as light, temperature, and appetite of the predators varied, but 
        both kinds of snakes were subject to the same variations. In this way, 
        the brown snakes <i>controlled,</i> or cancelled out, the effects of the 
        unwanted variables, leaving colored rings as the only consistent difference 
        between the two groups of snakes. Then any difference in the number of 
        attacks on the ringed snakes compared to the brown snakes could only have 
        been due to the difference in coloration.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">"If . . . , then . . ." Reasoning</span>  You 
        should now be able to recognize in this case study the same type of reasoning 
        you learned about in the flashlight example. Using the flowchart in Figure 
        2-15, you can follow the steps taken by the Pfennig team. Observations 
        of snake coloration and attacks by predators led to a question. The Pfennigs 
        posed a hypothesis that seemed reasonable based on other scientists' past 
        research on different animal species. The Pfennigs then designed and performed 
        a controlled experiment to test their hypothesis. The next step was analyzing 
        the data.</p>

      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Organizing Data and Interpreting Results </span> 
        Scientific inquiry is far from over once the data have been 
        collected. Often, the results of an experiment only begin to make sense 
        after much analysis of the data. For quantitative data, note again that 
        it is often helpful to put the data in the form of a table or graph. These 
        efforts may reveal patterns that were not obvious when the "raw" 
        data were first collected.</p>
      <p>The bar graph in Figure 2-16 summarizes the results of the artificial 
        snake experiment. The graph also reinforces the purpose of using two groups 
        of snakes. Of all attacks on artificial snakes, about 84 percent of attacks 
        were on the plain brown snakes compared to about 16 percent for the snakes 
        with colored rings. These data fit the prediction based on the mimicry 
        hypothesis. The experiment supports the hypothesis that the kingsnakes' 
        mimicry of coral-snake coloration helps protect against predators.</p>

      <p>The research on look-alike snakes provides an example of how scientists 
        use hypothesis-based science to test their explanation of natural phenonena. 
        Notice again how hypothesis-based science works along with discovery science. 
        Questions about nature usually arise from the observations of discovery 
        science. Hypothesis-based science is a process for testing the possible 
        answers to such questions.</p>
