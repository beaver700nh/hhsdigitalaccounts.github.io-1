<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>7.</b> In what ways does discovery science increase understanding about the natural world?</p>
<p><b>8.</b> What are quantitative data? Give an example of quantitative data.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Describe a generalization about nature that you can make based on your own observations.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Why is a controlled experiment a useful tool in hypothesis-based science?</p>
<p><b>11.</b> List characteristics that make a hypothesis scientific.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> What is the purpose of a scientific model?</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Describe the benefits scientists gain by sharing information with one another?</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>15.</b> Copy the concept map below and complete it.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="02images/02-cr-15.gif" width="275" height="359" ALT="flowchart"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>16. Analyzing Photographs</b> Study the photograph below. Then answer the questions that follow.<br>
<b>a.</b> Make and list at least four observations about the photo.<br>
<b>b.</b> Write one possible inference.<br>
<b>c.</b> Make a prediction about what will happen next.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="02images/02-cr-16.jpg" width="300" height="223" ALT="bear in a stream staring at some fish as they try to swim up a small waterfall"></p>

<p><b>17. Analyzing Graphs</b> The graph shows the results of an experiment in which mice learned to run through mazes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="02images/02-cr-17.gif" width="300" height="281" ALT="graph"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> State the hypothesis that you think this experiment tested.<br>
<b>b.</b> Identify the experimental variable. List at least two variables that must have been controlled so as not to affect the results.<br>
<b>c.</b> Do the data support the hypothesis? Explain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>18. Problem Solving</b> Suppose you observe your neighbor's dog barking at various times of the day and night. What other observations would help you hypothesize why the dog barks when it does?</p>

<p><b>19. Developing Hypotheses</b> Based on the results of the snake mimicry case study, suggest another hypothesis researchers might investigate further.</p>

<p><b>20. Evaluating Promotional Claims</b> Describe the strategies you would use to judge whether an advertisement for a diet supplement was reliable.</p>

<p><b>21. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> An inference is the answer to a scientific question.<br>
<b>b.</b> An experiment that shows a hypothesis to be false is wasted effort.<br>
<b>c.</b> Discovery science is not as scientific as hypothesis-based science.<br>
<b>d.</b> New evidence that does not fit an existing, widely accepted theory can be ignored.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> Plan an investigation to determine the direction in which plants grow in the dark. Write a reasonable hypothesis. Use the hypothesis to make a prediction that could be tested. Describe how you would set up the experiment. Identify the variable you want to test, and tell how you would control other variables.</p>
