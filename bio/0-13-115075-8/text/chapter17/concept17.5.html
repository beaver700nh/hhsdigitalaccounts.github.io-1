<p>The eukaryotic organisms with which you are most familiar are probably large plants and animals. How are these organisms related to protists? And how are protists related to even less complex prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria? Biologists hypothesize that protists evolved from ancient prokaryotes over a billion years ago. In turn, plants, animals, and fungi evolved from protists hundreds of millions of years ago. Can the process of science provide evidence to support these hypotheses?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Origin of Eukaryotes</span><br>
Among the most fundamental questions in biology is how the complex eukaryotic cell evolved from much simpler prokaryotic cells. A widely accepted theory is that eukaryotic cells evolved through a combination of two processes (Figure 17-18). In one process, internal membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and nuclear envelope evolved from inward folds of the plasma membrane of ancestral prokaryotic cells. Such internal membranes would allow the cell to carry out more complex chemical reactions in separate compartments.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>Evidence suggests that a second, very different process led to the existence of the cellular organelles mitochondria and chloroplasts. Scientists hypothesize that in this process, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gendosym.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gendosym.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">endosymbiosis</a>, chloroplasts and mitochondria evolved from small symbiotic prokaryotes that lived within other, larger host cells. (Symbiosis is a relationship between two organisms of different species that live in close contact with one another.)</p>

<p>The symbiotic ancestors of mitochondria may have been aerobic bacteria that were able to use oxygen in cellular respiration. An ancestral host cell may have ingested some of these aerobic cells for food. Instead of being digested, some of these bacterial cells might have remained alive and continued to perform respiration within the host cell. In a similar way, the ancestors of chloroplasts could have been photosynthetic bacteria that lived inside a larger host cell. Since almost all eukaryotes have mitochondria but only some have chloroplasts, it is likely that mitochondria evolved first.</p>

<p>The endosymbiosis theory is supported by a variety of evidence. For instance, present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar to prokaryotic cells in a number of ways. Both types of organelles contain DNA, RNA, and ribosomes, all of which resemble their counterparts in prokaryotes more than those in eukaryotes. In addition, mitochondria and chloroplasts copy their own DNA and reproduce within the host cell by a process resembling the binary fission of prokaryotes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Relationships Among Eukaryotes</span><br>
Researchers have not yet reached agreement for a complete classification scheme for protists. Figure 17-20 on the facing page is based on data from analyzing nucleic acid sequences of different protists. This analysis suggests that some protists are more closely related to certain plants, or to certain animals, or to certain fungi than they are to other protists.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="17images/17-20.gif" width="525" height="470" ALT="Figure 17-20"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 17-20<br>This hypothetical phylogenetic tree reflects recent trends in taxonomy based on molecular comparisons. Some protists, such as amoebas, are not listed here because it is still uncertain where they fit.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>In light of this new evidence, a single kingdom of protists may no longer make sense. The trend is to split the protists into several kingdoms, each a major evolutionary branch, or clade. In this remaking of taxonomy, the domain Eukarya would consist of the plant, fungal, and animal kingdoms, plus several protist kingdoms. It is still uncertain what the names and boundaries of these kingdoms should be. Any attempt to specify the number of kingdoms and their names would probably make the diagram (Figure 17-20) soon out-of-date. The classification of life, like all scientific inquiries, is a work in progress.</p>
