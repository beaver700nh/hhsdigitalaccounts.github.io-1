<p>Unlike protozoans and fungus-like protists, "algae" are plant-like protists that contain chloroplasts and can make their own food. Many algae are unicellular, some live in colonies, and still others are multicellular. Most algae have both asexual and sexual mechanisms of reproduction. Biologists classify these protists by their differences in cell wall, types of photosynthetic pigments, structure, types of storage carbohydrates, and now by nucleic acid sequences.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Euglenoids</span><br>
The <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/geugleno.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/geugleno.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">euglenoids</a> are a group of single-celled, photosynthetic protists that possess one or two flagella and lack cell walls. <i>Euglena,</i> shown in Figure 17-12, belongs to this group. Notice the presence of chloroplasts that enable the organism to carry out photosynthesis. Euglenoids live in fresh water, and though they do not have cell walls, their plasma membranes are rigid and tough but flexible. Emerging from a pocket at one end of the <i>Euglena</i> cell is a long flagellum that functions in cell movement. Near the base of the flagellum is a structure called an eyespot that functions with a light detector in sensing the direction from which light is coming. <i>Euglena</i> swims toward light, which powers photosynthesis.</p>

						</table></p>

<p><i>Euglena</i> is not always autotrophic. If placed in the dark, it can live as a heterotroph by absorbing organic nutrients from the environment. In fact, certain euglenoid-related species lack chloroplasts and ingest food into food vacuoles. Even though they lack a cell wall, most biologists include euglenoids with algae because they are mostly photosynthetic.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Dinoflagellates</span><br>
The <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdinofla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdinofla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dinoflagellates</a> are unicellular, mostly photosynthetic protists with a cell wall made of cellulose and two flagella. The two flagella beat in perpendicular grooves of the cell wall. This action produces the spinning movement for which these organisms are named. (<i>Dinos</i> is a Greek word that means "whirling.")</p>

<p>Found in both freshwater and saltwater environments, dinoflagellates are among the many unicellular algae that are components of plankton. <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplankto.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplankto.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Plankton</a> are the communities of mostly microscopic organisms that drift or swim near the surface of ponds, lakes, and oceans. Photosynthetic organisms in plankton, such as dinoflagellates, are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphytopl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphytopl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phytoplankton</a>. Those plankton that are protozoans or tiny animals are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/z/gzooplan.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/z/gzooplan.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">zooplankton</a>. For example, forams, which you read about in Concept 17.2, are among the zooplankton. Phytoplankton form the base of the food chain for most other aquatic organisms.</p>

<p>Although dinoflagellates are very small, they can have a visible impact on the environment. Dinoflagellates reproduce mainly by binary fission, and some species occasionally undergo population explosions. A large number of these organisms can cause coastal marine waters to turn pinkish-orange&#151;a phenomenon called red tide. Toxins produced by some red tide algae kill enormous numbers of fish. These toxins can also be harmful, even deadly, to humans who eat shellfish that have ingested the toxins.</p>

<p>Some dinoflagellate species have an ability to produce light, a property called bioluminescence. This light can create an eerie ocean glow at night when waves, boats, or swimmers stir up water containing dense populations of the bioluminescent dinoflagellates.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diatoms</span><br>
A glass-like cell wall is a unique characteristic of <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdiatom.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdiatom.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">diatoms</a>, another group of unicellular algae. A diatom's cell wall contains silica, the same mineral that makes up glass. These rigid cell walls give diatoms a variety of geometric shapes. The cell wall consists of two halves that fit together like the bottom and lid of a shoebox. Diatoms contain chlorophyll, but appear yellow or brown because they also contain other pigments that mask the green color. Both freshwater and marine environments are rich in diatoms, which are key members of plankton. They are as important a food source for many marine animals as grasses are for many land animals.</p>

<p>Diatoms store their food reserves in the form of an oil, which enables them to float near the surface where they are exposed to sunlight. When diatoms die, they no longer produce this oil, and they sink to the ocean floor. The glassy cell walls do not decompose and, over time, they accumulate and can become fossilized. Enormous numbers of fossilized diatoms make up thick sediments known as diatomaceous (dy uh tuh MAY shus) earth. This soil is mined for use as a filter material, as a grinding and polishing agent, and as an ingredient in some toothpastes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Seaweeds</span><br>
Most of the protists described so far are unicellular and microscopic. In contrast, <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gseaweed.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gseaweed.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">seaweeds</a> are large, multicellular marine algae. Some of these organisms can be as large as many plants and have specialized structures that resemble those of plants. However, seaweeds lack the true roots, stems, and leaves of plants. Because seaweeds seem to be more closely related to certain unicellular algae than they are to true plants, most biologists include seaweeds with protists. Seaweeds are classified into three different groups depending, in part, on what pigments they contain: brown algae, red algae, and green algae.</p>

<p>People harvest algae from all three seaweed groups for food. For example, in Japan and Korea, some seaweed species are common ingredients in soups and salads. Other seaweeds are used to wrap sushi. Marine algae are rich in iodine and other essential minerals. However, much of their organic material consists of unusual polysaccharides that humans cannot digest. Thus seaweeds are not used as a source of staple food. They are eaten mostly for their rich tastes and unusual textures.</p>

<p>In addition to cellulose, the cell walls of many seaweeds contain other polysaccharides that give them a slimy and rubbery feel. In their natural habitat, these substances help to cushion the organisms from wave damage in tidal areas. These polysaccharides are extracted for commercial use. For example, the extract carrageenan is widely used to thicken foods such as puddings and salad dressings. Algin, an extract of brown seaweed, is used to thicken foods and is also a common ingredient in cosmetics and paints. One extract of red algae called agar is used as the gelatin-like material on which microbiologists culture microorganisms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Brown Algae</span> The biggest and most complex seaweeds are the brown algae, named for their typical brown or olive color. The distinctive color is due to "accessory" pigments that are present in the chloroplasts along with chlorophyll. Many brown algae grow on rocky shores. These organisms must be able to tolerate wave action and the ebb and flow of daily tides.</p>

<p>Some species of brown algae called kelp may grow to heights of 60 meters. Kelp are anchored to the sea floor by root-like structures called holdfasts. However, seaweed holdfasts and plant roots have different structural details that provide evidence of separate evolutionary origins. Fishes, sea lions, sea otters, and gray whales regularly use the kelp "forest" ecosystems, feeding on the many organisms that live on and around the kelp.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Red Algae</span> The warm, coastal waters of the tropics are home to most types of red algae, another form of seaweed. These algae are named for a reddish pigment found in addition to chlorophyll in their chloroplasts. Of all seaweeds, red algae can live in the deepest water, because the red pigment can absorb blue and green light&#151;the light that penetrates most deeply in water.</p>

<p>Most red algae are multicellular, but none are as big as the giant brown kelps. Though red algae are generally soft-bodied, some, called coralline algae, have cell walls hardened by mineral deposits. Coralline algae commonly live in coral reefs (thus the name "coralline") where their hard parts contribute to the reef structure.</p>

<p>Life cycles in red algae are especially diverse. However, there is no stage of these life cycles that includes flagellated cells. These algae depend on water currents to bring gametes together.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Green Algae</span> Green algae, a group of photosynthetic protists that includes unicellular, colonial, and multicellular species, are named for their green chloroplasts. The largest green algae are seaweeds. Though there are many marine species, most green algae live in fresh water. Various species of unicellular green algae live as phytoplankton, and some even inhabit damp soil or snow. <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is a single-celled green alga. This common freshwater organism has two flagella and can sense and swim toward light. Although somewhat similar to organisms from the euglenoid group, <i>Chlamydomonas</i> has a cell wall, whereas euglenoids do not have a cell wall.</p>

<p><i>Volvox</i> is a colonial green alga shaped like a hollow ball. The colony consists of hundreds or thousands of cells that each look similar to <i>Chlamydomonas.</i> These cells are connected by bridges of cytoplasm.</p>

<p>Some multicellular green algae form filaments, long strings of cells attached end to end. Other multicellular species such as <i>Ulva</i> are large and complex enough to qualify as seaweeds along with the large brown and red algae.</p>

<p>Most green algae have complex life cycles, including both asexual and sexual reproductive stages. Nearly all reproduce sexually with flagellated gametes that swim toward one another and fuse. Many plant-like features of green algae, such as cellulose cell walls, the use of starch for food storage, and similar chloroplast structure and pigmentation, suggest that the ancestor of plants was a green alga. In fact, many biologists think that at least some green algae should be classified in the plant kingdom.</p>
