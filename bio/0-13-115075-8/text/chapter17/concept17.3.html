<p>Despite their common name, the organisms you will read about in this section are not really molds. As you will read in the next chapter, true molds are a type of fungus. What slime "molds" and fungi have in common is that both decompose dead organic material, such as the "mulch" on a forest floor.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Plasmodial Slime Molds</span><br>
The brightly colored, branching growth you might observe on a decaying log is likely a protist called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmod.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmod.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasmodial slime mold</a>. These organisms are common almost anywhere there is moist, decaying organic matter. Large and branching as it is, a plasmodial slime mold is not multicellular. Rather, it is a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplasium.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplasium.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasmodium</a>, a single mass of cytoplasm undivided by membranes or cell walls and containing many nuclei. (Do not confuse this word with the organism <i>Plasmodium,</i> the apicomplexan that causes malaria.) This giant "supercell" behaves somewhat like a large amoeba, extending pseudopodia that engulf bacteria and other bits of organic matter. Its web-like form is an adaptation that enlarges the organism's surface area, increasing its contact with food, water, and oxygen. Through a microscope, you can observe a plasmodium's cytoplasm stream in pulsing flows, first one way and then the other. Biologists hypothesize that this streaming distributes nutrients and oxygen throughout the organism.</p>

<p>As long as a plasmodial slime mold has ample food and water, it usually stays in the plasmodial stage. When food and water are in short supply, however, the organism stops growing and develops reproductive structures called fruiting bodies, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsporang.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsporang.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sporangia</a> (spoh RAN jee uh). Within the tips of the sporangia, meiosis produces haploid spores that can be dispersed by the wind. When conditions again become favorable, each spore releases an active haploid cell. Pairs of haploid cells fuse, forming diploid zygotes. Each zygote then develops into a new plasmodium, completing the life cycle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Cellular Slime Molds</span><br>
Like plasmodial slime molds, <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellsli.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellsli.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cellular slime molds</a> are decomposers that live mainly on decaying organic matter. Cellular slime molds challenge biologists' understanding of what it means to be a multicellular organism. These protists have both unicellular and multicellular stages in their life cycles. </p>

<p><i>Dictyostelium,</i> a common cellular slime mold, goes through three life cycle stages: individual, colony, and spore (Figure 17-10). Most of the time, this organism exists as solitary amoeba-like cells. These cells are haploid. They use pseudopodia to creep about and engulf bacteria and other food. When food is plentiful, the cells remain separate and reproduce asexually. But when food is scarce, the cells secrete chemicals that attract other <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. When many <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells gather together, eventually a slug-like colony is formed. This colony of cells then migrates a few centimeters, leaving a trail of slime. At this point, the colony begins to show characteristics of multicellular organisms. Some of the cells in the colony differentiate and form a stalk, while other cells form haploid spores. Under suitable conditions, haploid amoeba-like cells emerge from the spores and begin the next generation. This form of reproduction is asexual. As Figure 17-10 shows, cellular slime molds can also reproduce sexually.</p>

<p>Most biologists place plasmodial and cellular slime molds in the same taxonomic group. The next group of protists, however, are quite different from slime molds. Yet their mode of nutrition is still fungus-like.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Water Molds and Downy Mildews</span><br>
Another group of heterotrophic, fungus-like protists are water molds and downy mildews. Water molds generally decompose dead plants and animals in freshwater habitats. There are also parasitic water molds that sometimes grow on the skin or gills of fishes.</p>

<p>Water molds exist either as unicellular organisms or as thin, branching filaments that contain many nuclei. Water molds reproduce sexually when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm nucleus, forming a diploid zygote. When conditions are favorable, the zygote releases motile spores with two flagella.</p>

<p>Like water molds, downy mildews also produce an egg cell. The spores of downy mildews are spread by the wind, but these organisms can also form flagellated spores during their life cycle. Some downy mildews are plant parasites. For example, <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> infected potato plants in Ireland in the mid-1800s, causing the great Irish famine. This fungus-like protist destroyed Irish potato crops for several years. Since each plant was grown asexually from buds of parent plants, the potato crops consisted of clones. Lacking the genetic variation generated by sexual reproduction, there were no plants resistant to the downy mildew. During the Irish famine, nearly 1,000,000 people died from starvation or famine-related illnesses. And approximately 1,500,000 more people emigrated to England and North America to escape the famine.</p>

<p>Despite the similarity of fungus-like lifestyles, molecular analysis indicates that water molds and downy mildews are not closely related to slime molds. Instead, it seems that water molds and downy mildews are closely related to some of the algae that you will read about in Concept 17.4.</p>
