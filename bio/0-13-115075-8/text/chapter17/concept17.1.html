<p>Does your family have a drawer at home where you keep "stuff"? That drawer might include a flashlight, tape measure, spare keys, rubber bands, or extra stamps. These objects have little in common except that they are kept in the same drawer for convenience. Biologists have a sort of taxonomic "stuff" drawer: the kingdom Protista. Protista is a very diverse kingdom of organisms that do not fit neatly into any of the other kingdoms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Protists</span><br>
Eukaryotes that are not animals, plants, or fungi are classified as <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprotist.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprotist.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">protists</a>. Protists vary in structure and function more than any other group of organisms. Most protists are unicellular and free-living (not parasitic). However, some protist species are colonial&#150;organisms consisting of many similar or identical cells. There are even some protists, such as seaweeds, that are multicellular. These multicellular protists have relatively complex bodies consisting of specialized cells.</p>

<p>Protists have the typical eukaryotic cell structure, including internal membranes, a nucleus surrounded by a nuclear envelope, and organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (in some species). However, eukaryotic cell structure is a characteristic of <i>all</i> organisms other than bacteria and archaea. So cell structure alone does not define protists.</p>

<p>Most biologists think that with sufficient data the traditional protist kingdom will eventually be divided into several kingdoms within domain Eukarya. Comparing nucleic acid sequences helps researchers identify these main clades (evolutionary branches) of protists. However, evidence of these evolutionary relationships remains incomplete. Until there is a widely accepted division of these diverse organisms into multiple kingdoms, the term <i>protist</i> remains useful when studying the group.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Protists as the Most Complex Cells</span><br>
Being mostly unicellular, protists are considered the simplest form of eukaryotic organism. Clearly, humans are far more complex organisms than protists. However, in a way, individual human cells can be considered less complex than protists. Most human cells are highly specialized, carrying out only certain tasks. For example, some human cells manufacture enzymes that digest food. Other cells transmit nerve impulses in response to stimuli. By comparison, the protist's one cell must consume and process food, respond to stimuli, excrete wastes, and reproduce. At the cellular level, protists can justifiably be considered the most complex of eukaryotic cells, since each cell must carry out all of an organism's life functions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Grouping Protists by Types of Nutrition</span><br>
In taxonomy, classification is based ideally on evolutionary relationships. However, in a group as diverse as protists, it is convenient to have informal groupings based on other criteria. Thus, biologists often informally group organisms by how they obtain organic molecules. For example, heterotrophs obtain food from other organisms. In contrast, autotrophs construct all of their own organic molecules. You can think of these methods of obtaining food as different "lifestyles" for organisms. Lifestyle is useful to help understand protist adaptations and the roles they play in ecosystems.</p>

<p>The next sections of this chapter group protists by lifestyle: animal-like, fungus-like, and plant-like protists. Animal-like protists, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprotozo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprotozo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">protozoans</a>, are heterotrophs that ingest (eat) food. Fungus-like protists are also heterotrophs, but they mostly feed on decaying organic matter. Plant-like protists, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/galga.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/galga.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">algae</a> (singular, <i>alga</i>), are autotrophs, and make their own food by photosynthesis as plants do.</p>
