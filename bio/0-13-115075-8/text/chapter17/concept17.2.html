<p>Protozoans, the animal-like protists, are heterotrophs. They eat bacteria, other protists, or nonliving organic matter. Protozoans lack a cell wall. They inhabit most aquatic environments, including tiny drops of water on plants and in soil. Some protozoans live in the body fluids of living hosts.</p>

<p>One convenient way to categorize protozoans is by how they move. Some move rapidly, while others creep slowly. Still others are not capable of active movement at all, but instead rely on a host organism to supply their food. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Protozoans With Flagella</span><br>
<a href="../../glossary/terms/z/gzooflag.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/z/gzooflag.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Zooflagellates</a> (zoh oh FLAJ uh lits) move by means of one or more flagella. (Recall from Chapter 6 that flagella are long, thin, whip-like cellular projections.) Zooflagellates generally reproduce asexually by binary fission. Recall that asexual reproduction results in genetically identical offspring.</p>

<p>Though most species of zooflagellates are free-living, some are parasites. An example of a parasitic flagellate is <i>Giardia.</i> <i>Giardia</i> infects the human intestine and can cause abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea. People can become infected with <i>Giardia</i> by drinking water contaminated with feces from infected animals. Drinking such water from what may look like a clean stream or river can ruin a camping trip.</p>

<p>A single <i>Giardia</i> cell has two separate nuclei, a simple cytoskeleton, and other eukaryotic organelles. However, <i>Giardia</i> lacks mitochondria. These protists do not carry out cellular respiration, but instead they harvest energy from food by fermentation (see Chapter 7). <i>Giardia</i> and related flagellates have been the object of much attention from evolutionary biologists. Details of cell structure and RNA sequences support the hypothesis that these organisms are the eukaryotes most closely related to prokaryotes. This would support the hypothesis that <i>Giardia</i> never had mitochondria. However, other recent evidence supports a different hypothesis&#150;that <i>Giardia</i> and related protists once had mitochondria but lost them during their evolution.</p>

<p>Another parasitic zooflagellate, <i>Trypanosoma,</i> has a single large mitochondrion. This organism causes African sleeping sickness, a disease spread by the bite of the tsetse ((t)SET see) fly. Another flagellated protist, <i>Trichonympha,</i> lives in a symbiotic relationship in the gut of termites. The protist has enzymes that digest the cellulose in wood, contributing to the nutrition of the termite.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Protozoans With Pseudopodia</span><br>
Another group of protozoans, the amoebas, have a distinctive way of moving about. An amoeba moves and feeds by means of temporary extensions of its cytoplasm and plasma membrane called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpseudop.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpseudop.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pseudopodia</a> (singular, <i>pseudopodium</i>). Cytoplasm flows from one area of the cell into a pseudopodium extending outward from the cell. This enables the cell to move in the direction of the growing pseudopodium. Amoebas can take almost any shape as they creep over moist surfaces of rocks and plants, or over the mud at the bottom of a pond or the ocean. The amoeba also uses pseudopodia to surround prey, engulfing them into a food vacuole.</p>

<p>Another protozoan group with pseudopodia, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gforam.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gforam.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">forams</a>, inhabit marine environments. Forams have porous shells made of organic material and hard calcium carbonate. The foram extends long, thin pseudopodia through the pores in its shell. The shells of dead forams and other protists with calcium shells build up in ocean sediments, over time forming a type of rock called limestone.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Protozoans With Cilia</span><br>
<i>Paramecium,</i> a common pondwater organism, is an example of a ciliate. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gciliate.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gciliate.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Ciliates</a> are a diverse group of protozoans named for their use of hair-like projections called cilia to move and feed. Like <i>Paramecium,</i> most ciliates are free-living cells found in freshwater environments. </p>

<p>In contrast to flagella, cilia are shorter and usually present in much larger numbers. Researchers hypothesize that microtubules just beneath the cell's plasma membrane coordinate the movement of cilia. Some ciliates have many rows of cilia like <i>Paramecium,</i> whereas others have clusters of cilia in fewer rows or in tufts. The specific arrangements are adapted for different functions in various ciliates. <i>Stylonychia,</i> for example, scurries about on leglike structures consisting of many cilia joined together. In contrast, <i>Stentor</i> often attaches to a surface and uses cilia ringing its "mouth" to capture food. The cilia generate whirlpool-like currents that draw food organisms into the cell.</p>

<p>A unique feature of ciliates is the presence of two kinds of nuclei (Figure 17-7). Each cell has a large macronucleus and from 1 to as many as 80 micronuclei. The macronucleus coordinates various cellular activities, while the micronuclei are involved in sexual reproduction. Ciliates can reproduce asexually by fission, but they can also come together and exchange genetic material in a sexual process called conjugation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Protozoans Lacking Motility</span><br>
A fourth group of protozoans called <i>apicomplexans</i> are parasites with no means of active motility. This group gets its name from a structure called the "apical complex" at the tip of the cell that contains organelles specialized for penetrating host cells. A well-known apicomplexan is <i>Plasmodium,</i> the organism that causes malaria in humans (Figure 17-8). Spread by infected mosquitoes, malaria is a harmful and widespread human disease.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 17-8<br><i>Plasmodium,</i> the protozoan that causes malaria, has a complex life cycle that includes multiple hosts.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Most apicomplexans have intricate life cycles that involve two or more different host species. For example, part of the life cycle of <i>Plasmodium</i> occurs in the mosquito and part occurs in the human.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the rate of malaria decreased as insecticides were used to kill mosquitoes and new drugs were taken that killed  <i>Plasmodium</i> in infected humans. However, the spread of resistant varieties of both the mosquitoes and the <i>Plasmodium</i> species has enabled the disease to resurge.</p>
