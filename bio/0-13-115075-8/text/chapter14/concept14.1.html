<p>A new view of life came into focus in 1859, when Charles Darwin published his book <i>The Origin of Species.</i> Darwin's ideas provided a framework for understanding Earth's diversity of organisms and their relationships to one another and with their environments. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Ideas From Darwin's Time</span><br>
On its grandest scale, <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gevoluti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gevoluti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">evolution</a> is all of the changes that have transformed life over an immense time. In a sense, evolution is the biological history of life on Earth. Before Darwin, two ideas about life on Earth prevailed. One was that species are fixed, or permanent. In other words, they do not change. The other idea was that Earth itself is less than 10,000 years old and also relatively unchanging. These ideas were challenged as people became aware of the incredible diversity of organisms, past and present, and the nature of Earth's geologic processes.</p>

<p>In the mid-1700s, the study of fossils led French naturalist Georges Buffon to suggest that Earth might be much older than a few thousand years. He also observed that specific fossils and certain living animals were similar but not exactly alike. In the early 1800s, another French naturalist, Jean Baptiste Lamarck, suggested an explanation of Buffon's observations. Lamarck proposed that life evolves, or changes. He recognized that species are not permanent. Lamarck explained evolution as a process of adaptation. Today, biologists consider an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gadaptat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gadaptat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">adaptation</a> to be an inherited characteristic that improves an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in a particular environment. An example of evolutionary adaptation is the massive hind legs of a kangaroo that moves about by hopping and leaping.</p>

<p>Today, Lamarck is unfairly remembered in large part for his mistaken explanation of how adaptations evolve. He proposed that by using or not using certain body parts, an organism develops certain characteristics. Lamarck thought that these enhanced characteristics would be passed on to the offspring. Lamarck called this idea <i>inheritance of acquired characteristics.</i> For example, Lamarck might explain that a kangaroo's powerful hind legs were the result of ancestors strengthening  their legs by jumping and then passing that acquired leg strength on to offspring. However, an acquired characteristic would have to somehow modify the DNA of specific genes in order to be inherited. There is no evidence that this happens. Still, it is important to note that Lamarck proposed that evolution occurs when organisms adapt to their environments. This idea helped set the stage for Darwin.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Voyage of the <i>Beagle</i></span><br>
On a cold December day in 1831, the HMS <i>Beagle</i> set sail on a voyage around the world. Figure 14-3 shows the route the ship followed. The main mission of the voyage was to chart poorly known stretches of the South American coastline for the British navy. Accompanying the captain was a 22-year-old college graduate, Charles Darwin. Darwin's main interest was to study the geology, plants, and animals encountered on the voyage. It was a tour that would greatly affect Darwin's thinking and eventually the thinking of many others.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Darwin's Observations</span> Darwin spent most of his time on shore while the ship's crew was busy surveying. There, he observed and collected thousands of specimens of South American plants and animals from diverse environments. He studied organisms and their adaptations from places as different as the Brazilian jungle, the grasslands of the pampas, and the frigid lands near Antarctica.</p>

<p>Throughout the voyage and the rest of his life, Darwin maintained extensive journals of his observations, studies, and thoughts. These journals provide a window into Darwin's thinking. His writings indicate that before the voyage he felt that the concept of fixed or unchanging species best described nature. During the voyage, he began to question this concept. Sometime after he returned to England, Darwin became convinced that species change as they adapt to their changing environments.</p>

<p>Darwin noticed that the plants and animals throughout the continent all had a definite South American character. They were quite distinct from the species of Europe. Even the fossils that Darwin found were uniquely South American. Some of the fossils were gigantic versions of the modern animals. His observations supported the idea that species living in South America today were descended from ancestral species on that continent.</p>

<p>Darwin was intrigued by life on islands such as the Gal&aacute;pagos. The Gal&aacute;pagos are a chain of relatively young volcanic islands about 900 kilometers off the western coast of South America (Figure 14-4). Darwin observed that the islands had many unique organisms. Most of the species on the islands were similar to, but different from the plants and animals of the nearest mainland. He observed that even the individual islands in the chain had some different species of plants and animals from one another. Darwin inferred from these observations that mainland species had changed after they colonized the islands and adapted to their various new environments.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ideas From Geology</span> During the <i>Beagle's</i> long sails between ports, Darwin managed to do a lot of reading in spite of his seasickness. The writings of the geologist Charles Lyell had a particularly strong influence on Darwin. Lyell proposed that gradual and observable geologic processes such as erosion could explain the physical features of today's Earth. For example, the gradual erosion of a riverbed over thousands or millions of years can result in a deep, river-carved canyon. A mighty mountain range can be thrust up centimeter by centimeter by earthquakes occurring over millions of years. All that was required for an understanding of these changes was an Earth far older than previously thought.</p>

<p>Darwin personally experienced an earthquake while doing field studies in the Andes Mountains of Chile. In a harbor, he observed a block of land that had been underwater move upward above the water level as a result of the quake. He also collected fossils of ocean organisms high in the Andes. Applying Lyell's ideas, Darwin reasoned that earthquakes gradually lifted the rock bearing those marine fossils from the sea floor.</p>

<p>The geologic evidence presented by Lyell and others pointed to two conclusions. First, the slow processes of mountain building and erosion suggested an Earth that must be very old. Second, these slow and gradual processes occurring over vast spans of time could cause enormous change on Earth. Darwin would eventually apply this idea of gradual change to the evolution of Earth's life forms.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Darwin Publishes His Theory</span><br>
Darwin and the <i>Beagle</i> returned to England after five years at sea. Letters and specimens he had sent back to England established Darwin's reputation with other scientists. He left as a young graduate and returned as a famous naturalist. After his return, he analyzed his collection and became convinced that Earth was ancient and that species can change through time. As Darwin contemplated a mechanism for evolutionary change, he began to construct a scientific theory built on observations, inferences, and ideas from his own work and the work of others. Figure 14-7 summarizes some of Darwin's experiences.</p>

<p>In 1838, as Darwin continued to think about the question of how species change, he read an essay on human populations written a few decades earlier by Thomas Malthus. Malthus contended that much of human suffering, such as disease, famine, and homelessness, was due to the human population's potential to grow. That is, populations can grow much faster than the rate at which supplies of food and other resources can be produced. Darwin recognized that Malthus's ideas applied to all species. The production of more individuals than the environment can support leads to a struggle for existence. This concept helped Darwin to propose a mechanism of evolutionary change.</p>

<p>In 1844, Darwin wrote a 200-page essay that outlined his idea, but he didn't release it to the public. Instead, for the next several years he continued to accumulate more evidence to support his idea. He told only a few of his closest colleagues, who encouraged him to publish his work before someone else came to the same conclusions. In 1858, another British naturalist, Alfred Wallace, <i>did</i> come to the same conclusion. Darwin was shocked to receive a letter from Wallace that described the same basic mechanism for evolutionary change that Darwin had proposed. Within a month, some of Wallace's and Darwin's writings were jointly presented in public. Darwin published his book <i>The Origin of Species</i> about a year later.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Darwin's Two Main Points</span><br>
Darwin made two main points in his book. First, he argued from evidence that the species of organisms living on Earth today descended from ancestral species. In other words, life has a history of change. Darwin proposed that the descendants of the earliest organisms spread into various habitats over millions of years. In these habitats, they accumulated different modifications, or adaptations, to diverse ways of life. Darwin called this process <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdescent.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdescent.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">descent with modification</a>. He saw descent with modification as a way to account for the diversity of life. For example, the jackrabbit and the snowshoe hare are two species of hares that have adapted to living in different environments. The jackrabbit benefits from fur that blends well in the desert and ears, rich with blood vessels, that help cool its body. White fur provides protective camouflage in the snowy northern regions of the snowshoe hare's range.</p>

<p>Darwin's second main point was his argument for <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnatural.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnatural.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">natural selection</a> as the mechanism for evolution. Natural selection is the process by which individuals with inherited characteristics well-suited to the environment leave more offspring on average than do other individuals. Figure 14-9 models how certain inherited traits can give individuals some advantage over other individuals of the same species in the same environment. This process, which you will read more about later in this chapter, can cause a population to change over time. When biologists speak of "Darwin's theory of evolution," they are referring to natural selection as a cause of evolution. The result of natural selection is adaptation. This process of natural selection is another way of defining evolution. But the term <i>evolution</i> can also be used on a much broader scale to mean the history of life, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.</p>
