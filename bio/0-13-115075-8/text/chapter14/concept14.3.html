<p>Darwin saw a link between adaptation to the environment and the origin of new species. He realized that the key to understanding the mechanism of evolution was in explaining how adaptations arise. His theory of natural selection remains biology's best explanation for adaptive evolution.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection</span><br>
In biology, a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpopulat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpopulat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">population</a> is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time. Suppose an animal species from a mainland colonizes a chain of distant and isolated islands. The individuals of that species on each island make up a separate population. Populations on the different islands would adapt to their local environments. Over time, the isolated populations would become more and more different. And over many generations, the populations could become different enough to be separate species. The evolution of finches on the Galápagos Islands is an example. Darwin did not realize the significance of these finches until later, after he returned to England. Still, these finches are known as "Darwin's finches" for their contribution to the theory of natural selection.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Observations Lead to a Question</span> There are 13 species of finches unique to the Galápagos islands. However, they most closely resemble one finch species living on the South American mainland. A reasonable hypothesis is that the islands were colonized by a single finch species that strayed from the mainland. This single species adapted to the varied habitats on the islands and eventually diversified into the 13 species seen today. A key characteristic of the finches is their beaks, which are adapted to specific foods available on the different islands. A question that follows is, "How did these different beaks arise?" Darwin's theory proposes that these differences arose through natural selection.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">More Observations Lead to an Idea</span> Darwin based his theory of natural selection on two key sets of observations. First, drawing from Malthus's ideas about humans, Darwin recognized that all species tend to produce excessive numbers of offspring. But in nature, resources are limited. The production of more individuals than the environment can support leads to a struggle for existence among the individuals of a population. In most cases, only a small percentage of offspring will survive in each generation. Many eggs are laid, many young are born, and many seeds are spread, but only a tiny fraction complete their development and leave offspring of their own. The rest are starved, eaten, frozen, diseased, unmated, or unable to reproduce for other reasons.</p>

<p>Darwin's second set of observations was his awareness of variation among the individuals of a population. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvariati.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvariati.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Variation</a> refers to differences among members of the same species. You need only look around your classroom to see how hair color, skin tone, and facial features, for example, vary among just a small group of people. Just as no two people in a human population are alike, individual variation is widespread in all species. Much of this variation is heritable and passes from generation to generation. This explains why siblings usually share more traits with one another and with their parents than they do with unrelated members of the same population.</p>

<p>From these two sets of observations Darwin developed his theory of natural selection, summarized in Figure 14-19. Individuals with inherited traits that are best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less fit individuals. In other words, the individuals that function best tend to leave the most offspring. When this process repeats over many generations, each new generation has a higher proportion of individuals with the advantageous traits.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>Darwin also reasoned that natural selection could eventually cause two isolated populations of the same species to become separate species as they adapted to their different environments. This would explain patterns such as those observed in the Gal&aacute;pagos finches.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Artificial Selection</span><br>
Darwin found convincing evidence for his ideas in the results of artificial selection. <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gartific.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gartific.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Artificial selection</a> is the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals to produce offspring with genetic traits that humans value. For instance, a plant breeder might seek to improve traits such as grain production, disease resistance, or protein content. An animal breeder might select for growth rate or temperament. Darwin observed that breeders selected individuals with the desired traits as breeding stock. Breeders play the role of the environment, allowing only those plants or animals with desired traits to reproduce. </p>

<p>In fact, humans have been modifying species for thousands of years. You can see evidence of Darwin's point in the enormous diversity that dog breeders have produced within this single species in just the last 500 years.</p>

<p>Darwin observed that artificial selection could produce a great deal of change in a species in a short time. He reasoned that over thousands of generations, natural selection could also cause major change. Of course, there are important differences between artificial and natural selection. The traits that become more common in a population through artificial selection are those that humans choose. In contrast, natural selection favors traits that benefit the organisms in their particular environment&#151;environmental conditions do the "selective breeding." The result is the evolutionary adaptation to the environment.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Pesticides&#151;Natural Selection in Action</span><br>
Natural selection and the evolution it causes can be observable events. An example is the evolution of pesticide resistance in hundreds of insect species. Pesticides are poisons used to kill insects that are pests in crops and in homes. Whenever a new type of pesticide is used to control agricultural pests, the story is usually the same. Early results are encouraging. A relatively small amount of poison dusted onto a crop may kill 99 percent of the insects. But later sprayings are less and less effective. For example, the flour beetle (<i>Tribolium castaneum</i>) is a pest species that damages stored grain. In the early 1950s, the pesticide malathion was introduced to control these insects. At first only a small concentration of malathion was necessary to control them. Today, wild flour beetles are resistant to very high concentrations of malathion.</p>

<p>Figure 14-21 traces how pesticide resistance evolves. Most survivors of the first pesticide treatments were insects with genes that somehow enabled them to resist the chemical attack. Their offspring inherited the genes for pesticide resistance. In each generation, the percentage of pesticide-resistant individuals in the beetle population increased. The population underwent evolutionary change that resulted in adaptation to a change in the chemical environment&#151;the presence of the pesticide.</p>

<p>This example highlights two key points about natural selection. First, natural selection is a process of "screening" traits that are available. A pesticide does not create resistant individuals, but selects for resistant insects that are already present in the population. Second, natural selection favors those characteristics in a varying population that fit the specific current, local environment. Pesticide resistance offered no advantage until pesticide application changed the local environment.</p>
