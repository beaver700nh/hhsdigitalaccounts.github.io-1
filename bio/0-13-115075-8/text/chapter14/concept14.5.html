<p>How does evolutionary biology fit into everyday life? One clear connection is in the efforts of scientists to understand some health problems in an evolutionary context. What can evolution reveal about inherited disease? How can infectious diseases that were once seemingly defeated or controlled by drugs now be on the rise? Biologists are now seeking answers to these questions in an evolutionary framework. Two examples are described here.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Natural Selection and Sickle Cell Disease</span><br>
In some African populations, sickle cell disease affects about 
1 out of every 25 individuals. The disease is named for the abnormal shape of red blood cells in individuals who inherit the disorder. People with the disease suffer a range of symptoms that include general weakening of the body, pain, damage to organs, and sometimes death. Sickle cell disease is caused by a recessive allele. Only homozygous individuals&#151;those who inherit the recessive allele from both parents&#151;have the disorder. Heterozygous individuals&#151;those with a single copy of the sickle cell allele&#151;do not have the disease. But they can pass the allele on to their children. (You can review the inheritance of sickle cell disease in Chapters 10 and 11.)</p>

<p>Why do many African populations have such high frequencies of an allele with the potential to shorten life (and thus reproductive success)? Evolutionary biology holds a possible answer. Although the sickle cell allele has harmful effects, in the African tropics it is also beneficial. Individuals with just one copy of the sickle cell allele are resistant to the disease malaria. This resistance is an important advantage in environments where malaria is a major cause of death in infants.</p>

<p>The map in Figure 14-33 indicates that the frequency of the sickle cell allele in Africa is generally highest in areas where the malaria parasite is most common. For some populations, as many as one out of three people carry a single copy of the sickle cell allele and are resistant to malaria. In populations with a high frequency of the sickle cell allele, 4 percent of the population is homozygous and suffers from the disease. However, 32 percent of the population is heterozygous and gains protection from malaria. With malaria common in the environment, natural selection maintains a higher frequency of the sickle cell allele than would be expected from the negative effects of the allele alone.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria</span><br>
Medicines that kill or slow the growth of bacteria are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gantibio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gantibio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">antibiotics</a>. These drugs help to cure many infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics have saved the lives of millions of people. But the widespread use of antibiotics also brings risk. It has caused the evolution of antibiotic-resistant populations of the very bacteria the drugs are meant to kill.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance evolves by natural selection, much as pesticide resistance evolves in insects. An antibiotic causes selection among the varying bacteria of a population, leaving those individuals that can survive the drug. While the drug kills most of the bacteria, the resistant bacteria multiply and quickly become the norm in the population rather than the exceptions.</p>

<p>The evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a huge problem in public health. For example, in New York City, there are now some strains of the tuberculosis-causing bacteria that are resistant to all three antibiotics used to treat the disease. Unfortunate people infected with one of these resistant strains have no better chance of surviving than tuberculosis patients did a century ago.</p>

<p>Understanding how populations of bacteria adapt to antibiotics is beginning to influence how doctors prescribe antibiotics.  Realizing that the overruse of these drugs is speeding the evolution of resistant bacteria, many doctors are less likely to prescribe antibiotics unless absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>It will take an organized effort by scientists, health care professionals, and patients  to effectively meet this challenge to public health. Underlying the effort is the need to see that evolution is not <i>just</i> a powerful theory for understanding life. On both a short-term and a long-term basis, grasping the principles of evolution helps people understand human interactions with the rest of the living world.</p>
