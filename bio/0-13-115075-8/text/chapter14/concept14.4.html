<p>Darwin understood the connection between natural selection and adaptation to the environment. However, he could not explain how the variations that are the basis for natural selection pass from one generation to the next. Gregor Mendel might have been some help. Mendel figured out the inheritance piece of the puzzle. But though they lived in the same era, Darwin knew nothing of Mendel's work. It wasn't until decades after both men were dead that biologists were able to apply Mendel's genetics to Darwin's ideas about natural selection. This union of genetics with evolutionary biology focuses on change within populations.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Populations and Their Gene Pools</span><br>
You learned earlier that a biological population is a local group of individuals belonging to the same species. A population is the smallest level at which evolution can occur. A common but mistaken belief is that individual organisms evolve. It is true that natural selection does act on individuals, and inherited characteristics do affect their reproductive success. However, this natural selection only becomes clear when an entire population is tracked over time.</p>

<p>A key concept in understanding the evolution of populations is the gene pool. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenepoo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenepoo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gene pool</a> consists of all the alleles (alternative forms of genes) in all the individuals that make up a population. You can think of the gene pool as the reservoir from which the next generation draws its genes. As such, the population's gene pool is where genetic variation&#151;the raw material of evolution&#151;is stored.</p>

<p>You can observe evidence of a gene pool's reservoir of variations in a population of wild mustangs. Each mustang has a unique combination of genes. This uniqueness is reflected in individual variations such as the horses' coloring. The variety expressed among individuals is largely the result of sexual recombination, and it is typical in populations that reproduce sexually. The processes of meiosis and fertilization (see Chapter 9) shuffle alleles within the gene pool and deal them out to offspring in fresh combinations.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Changes in Gene Pools</span><br>
The processes that lead to genetic variation&#151;mutations and sexual recombination&#151;are random. That is, the precise outcome of these processes for any individual can't be predicted. However, natural selection (and thus evolution) is <i>not</i> random. The environment favors genetic combinations that contribute to survival and reproductive success. Thus, some alleles may become more common than others in the gene pool. In other words, there is a change in the <i>frequency of alleles</i>&#151;how often certain alleles occur in the gene pool. This frequency is usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage, as shown by the example in Figure 14-24.</p>

<p>Merging Mendel's and Darwin's theories led to a way of looking at evolution based on genetic changes in populations. <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmicroev.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmicroev.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Microevolution</a> is evolution on the smallest scale&#151;a generation-to-generation change in the frequencies of alleles within a population.</p>

<p>In contrast to microevolution, populations that do not undergo change to their gene pools are not presently evolving. This condition is known as the <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghardywe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghardywe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</a> (named for the two scientists who first described it). Such equilibrium of a gene pool means that the frequency of alleles in that gene pool are constant over time. In fact, populations rarely remain in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for long in nature. But the concept is useful because it provides a "no change" baseline that makes it possible to recognize when a gene pool <i>is</i> changing.</p>

<p>What mechanisms can change a gene pool? The two main factors are genetic drift and natural selection, as you'll read in the following section.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Genetic Drift</span><br>
A change in the gene pool of a population due to chance is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenedri.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenedri.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genetic drift</a>. For example, the first generation of the small wildflower population illustrated in Figure 14-25 consists of nine plants with red flowers (<i>RR</i> and <i>Rr</i>) and one plant with white flowers (<i>rr</i>). It is partly chance that affects which plants reproduce. By the third generation, no plants carry the allele for white flowers. The result is a change in allele frequencies in this population.</p>


					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="14images/14-25.gif" width="525" height="246" ALT="Figure 14-25"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 14-25<br>Only the alleles of organisms that successfully reproduce in one generation appear in the gene pool of the next generation. In this population of ten plants, the frequency of white-flower alleles was reduced to zero due to genetic drift.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>All populations are subject to some genetic drift. However, the smaller the population is, the more impact genetic drift has on that population. It is like the erratic outcome from a small sample of coin tosses. Flip a coin 1,000 times, and a result of 700 heads and 300 tails would make you very suspicious about that coin. But flip a coin ten times, and an outcome of seven heads and three tails would seem within reason. The smaller the sample is, the greater the chance that the results will differ from an expected result&#151;in this case, a roughly equal number of heads and tails. As in coin tosses, the frequencies of alleles in a gene pool will be more stable from one generation to the next when a population is large. But in small populations, the allele frequencies can vary erratically from generation to generation. As you will see in the following two situations, genetic drift can have major effects on a population.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Bottleneck Effect</span> Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, and fires may drastically reduce the size of a population. Reducing the size of the population also reduces the size of its gene pool (Figure 14-26). By chance, certain alleles may then be represented more frequently than others among the survivors. Some alleles may be eliminated altogether. Such genetic drift, called the bottleneck effect, decreases genetic variation in a population.</p>


					<p align="center"><table width="290" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="14images/14-26.gif" width="290" height="248" ALT="Figure 14-26"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 14-26<br>Marbles falling through the narrow neck of a bottle serve as an analogy for the bottleneck effect. Compared to the original population (in the bottle) the new population has less variation.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The loss of variation due to a bottleneck effect could reduce the ability of a population to adapt to environmental change. For example, the cheetah&#151;the fastest running of all animals&#151;may have suffered one or more bottleneck events. Like many African mammals, a sharp decrease in the cheetah population occurred during the last ice age about 10,000 years ago. In the nineteenth century, farmers hunted the animals to near extinction. Today only a few small populations of cheetahs exist in the wild. Some biologists who study cheetahs are concerned that with relatively little variation in their gene pools, the cheetah populations may not be able to resist disease or adapt to other environmental challenges to their survival.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Founder Effect</span> Genetic drift is also likely when a few individuals colonize an isolated island, lake, or some other new habitat. The smaller the colony, the less its genetic makeup will represent the gene pool of the larger population from which the colonists came. Again, chance reduces genetic variation. Genetic drift in a new colony is known as the founder effect because the change relates to the genetic makeup of the founders of the colony. The founder effect likely contributed to changes in the gene pools of the finches and other South American organisms that arrived as strays on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Gene Flow and Mutation</span><br>
Although genetic drift and natural selection are the main causes of changes in gene pools from one generation to the next, other mechanisms also have a role. These mechanisms include gene flow and mutation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Gene Flow</span> The exchange of genes with another population is referred to as <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneflo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneflo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gene flow</a>. Gene flow occurs when fertile individuals or their gametes (sex cells) migrate between populations. For example, suppose a population that neighbors the wildflowers pictured in Figure 14-25 consists entirely of white-flowered individuals. A windstorm may blow pollen from these neighbors to the mostly red-flowered population. Interbreeding would increase the frequency of the white-flower allele in the original population. Gene flow tends to reduce genetic differences between populations. If it is extensive enough, gene flow can eventually mix neighboring populations into a single population with a common gene pool.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mutation</span> From Chapter 11, you may remember that a mutation is a change in an organism's DNA. If this mutation is carried by a gamete, the mutation enters the population's gene pool.</p>

<p>Natural selection or genetic drift (or both) can influence whether the frequency of a new mutation increases in a population. For example, albino deer carry a type of mutation, found in many vertebrate species, that results in a lack of coloration. Natural selection can affect the frequency of the mutant allele in the population. White fur may lend an advantage to animals that live in snowy climates most of the year and must escape predators to survive. In such a population, this allele might increase in frequency. But deer live in wintry conditions only one season out of four. White fur could prove harmful most of the time, so the frequency of such an allele in deer populations would most likely not increase.</p>

<p>Over the long term, mutation plays a key role in evolution as the original source of the genetic variation that is the raw material for natural selection. Mutations are especially important as a source of variation in asexually reproducing organisms that clone themselves rapidly, such as bacteria. For example, a new mutation that is favorable can rapidly increase in frequency in a bacteria population due to natural selection. In sexually reproducing organisms with relatively long generation spans, most of the variation is not due to new mutations but to the scrambling of existing alleles, including those that originated as mutations in earlier generations.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Natural Selection and Fitness</span><br>
Genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation can cause microevolution, or changes in allele frequencies. But they do not necessarily lead to adaptation. Only blind luck would improve a population's fitness in its environment through these processes. Of all causes of microevolution, only natural selection usually leads to adaptation. Natural selection is a blend of chance and sorting. Chance stems from mutations and the sexual recombination of alleles. These random events produce genetic variation in a population. Sorting, which is <i>not</i> random, is accomplished by differences in reproductive success among members of the varying population.</p>

<p>The phrases "struggle for existence" and "survival of the fittest" are sometimes used to describe natural selection. But these phrases are misleading since they suggest that natural selection usually involves direct contests between individuals. There are animal species in which individuals, usually the males, lock horns or otherwise do combat for mates. But competition is generally less dramatic. In a varying population of moths, certain individuals may average more offspring than others because their wing colors hide them better from predators. Plants in a wildflower population may differ in reproductive success because slight variations in flower color, shape, or fragrance make the plants better able to attract pollinators.</p>

<p>These examples point to a biological definition of <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfitness.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfitness.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fitness</a>&#151;the contribution that an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation compared to the contributions of other individuals. Survival to reproductive maturity, of course, is necessary for reproductive success. But even the biggest, fastest, toughest frog in the pond has a fitness of zero if it is sterile. Production of healthy, fertile offspring is all that counts in natural selection.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Return to the Gal&aacute;pagos</span><br>
Earlier you learned how Darwin's observations of island species influenced his thinking. The geology, plants, and animals of the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands were a particularly rich source of information for him. Even today, the unique conditions of the Gal&aacute;pagos continue to serve as a living laboratory for studying natural selection. One of the best studied examples of natural selection involves the birds called "Darwin's finches."</p>

<p>For 30 years, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their students have been studying the finches of Daphne Major in the Gal&aacute;pagos. Daphne Major is an isolated, uninhabited island about the size of a football stadium. Two species of finch inhabit the island, the medium ground finch and the cactus finch. The island's small size and limited population of finches make it an excellent setting for studying natural selection. Each year the Grants and their students have captured, marked, measured, and studied every finch on the island. With these data, they have been able to provide clear evidence for natural selection.</p>

<p>One of the Grants' research projects focuses on beak size in the medium ground finch. This finch uses its strong beak to crush seeds. Given a choice of small or large seeds, the birds eat mostly small ones, which are easier to crush. Large seeds from one plant species are common on the island. But these large seeds are particularly difficult to crack. During wet years, small seeds are so abundant that ground finches eat relatively few large seeds. However, in dry years all seeds are in short supply, and the large seeds make up a greater part of the birds' diet. Those birds with larger beaks are more successful at cracking the large seeds. Dry years are difficult, and there are usually more deaths. The surviving finches tend to be those with larger beaks that can crack the toughest seeds. This trend of larger beaks continues into the next generation of finches in the following year. The most likely explanation is that those birds with stronger beaks have a feeding advantage. Thus, they have more reproductive success during droughts and pass the genes for thicker beaks on to their offspring.</p>

<p>When wet years return to Daphne Major, the plants that produce small seeds recover. Small seeds are a more efficient food source for finches than large seeds. During wet years, birds with smaller beaks appear to forage for seeds more efficiently than the large-beaked birds. The average beak size in the population of birds changes again. The Grants have documented several such cycles of natural selection over their 30-year study. Figure 14-31 presents a simplified graph of some of their results.</p>

<p>Darwin thought that natural selection always works too slowly to actually be measured during a human lifetime. But the research of the Grants and many others has changed that view and provided many examples of natural selection in action.</p>
