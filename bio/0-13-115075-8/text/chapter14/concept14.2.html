<p>Evolution leaves observable signs. Such clues to the past are essential to any historical science. Biological evolution has left marks on all aspects of life&#151;in the fossil record and in the diverse assortment of modern species.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Fossil Record</span><br>
Preserved remains or markings left by organisms that lived in the past are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfossil.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfossil.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fossils</a>. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sand and silt eroded from the land are carried by rivers to seas and swamps, where the particles settle to the bottom. Over millions of years, deposits pile up and compress the older sediments below into rock. Rock strata, or layers, form when the rates of sedimentation or the types of particles forming the sediments vary over time. Aquatic organisms can become fossils when they die and are buried in sediments in a way that preserves some of their structure. Land organisms can become fossils in a similar way, if they are swept into rivers, lakes, swamps, and seas. Other remains of land dwellers may become fossils after being covered by windblown dust, sand, or volcanic ash.</p>

<p>Younger rock strata usually are layered on top of older ones, as illustrated in Figure 14-10. Thus, the positions of fossils in the rock strata can reveal their relative age. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfossilr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfossilr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fossil record</a> is this chronological collection of life's remains in the rock layers, recorded during the passage of time.</p>

<p>The fossil record provides evidence of Earth's changing life. The oldest fossil evidence of life consists of chemical traces in rocks from Greenland that are 3.8 billion years old. Fossils of prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) have been found in rocks of about 3.5 billion years in age. These data fit with the molecular and cellular evidence that prokaryotes are the oldest form of life. Fossils in younger layers of rock record the evolution of various groups of eukaryotic organisms. Fossils of species that became <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gextinct.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gextinct.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">extinct</a>&#151;species that no longer exist&#151;help scientists reconstruct the past. </p>

<p>Paleontologists (scientists who study fossils) have discovered fossils of many ancestral life forms that link past and present. For example, fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that whales, which have no hind limbs, evolved from land-dwelling ancestors that had four limbs. Paleontologists digging in Egypt and Pakistan have identified ancient whales that had hind limb bones. Figure 14-11 shows the hind leg bones of <i>Basilosaurus,</i> one of those early whales. These whales, which lived about 40 million years ago, were aquatic animals that no longer used their legs to support their weight. Even larger leg bones are found in fossils of older whale species that may have split their time between living on land and in water.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Geographic Distribution</span><br>
The differences and similarities between organisms in different parts of the world were some of the first observations that Darwin made on his voyage. These observations suggested to Darwin that today's organisms evolved from ancestral forms.</p>

<p>Many patterns in the geographic distribution of life forms make sense in an evolutionary context. Why do some animals of the South American tropics share more features with certain  species in the South American deserts than they do with species in the African tropics? Why is Australia home to so many kinds of pouched mammals (marsupials)&#151;such as kangaroos and koalas&#151;while very few placental animals&#151;such as deer and squirrels&#151;live there? (Placental mammals are mammals whose young complete their embryonic development before birth.) It is <i>not</i> because placental mammals are unable to survive in Australia. Humans have introduced rabbits, foxes, dogs, cats, and many other placental mammals to Australia. Several of these species have thrived to the point of becoming ecological and economic nuisances. The most widely accepted hypothesis suggests that Australia's diverse marsupial species evolved from marsupial ancestors on an island continent that was isolated from placental mammals.</p>

<p>Just as the fossil record documents the history of species of the past, the geographic distribution of organisms serves as a clue to how modern species may have evolved. As an example, consider two islands with similar environments in different parts of the world. The species on each island have more similarities to species on the nearest mainland than they do to species on the other island. If species evolved from ancestors that lived in one geographic region, the presence of related species in that region today makes sense. As you'll read in Chapter 15, the origin of new species is closely linked to Earth's changing geography and environmental conditions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Similarities in Structure</span><br>
Certain similarities in structure among species provide clues to evolutionary history. For example, the forelimbs of all mammals consist of the same skeletal parts. Human arms, cat forelegs, whale flippers, and bat wings all have the same basic combination of bones (Figure 14-13). The functions of these forelimbs differ, however. You know that a whale's flipper does not do the same job as a bat's wing. Since the functions of these limbs are completely different, you might expect that their structures would also be entirely different. Yet, that is not the case. Arms, forelegs, flippers, and wings of different mammals are variations on a common structural theme&#151;one that has become adapted to different functions. Such similar structures in species sharing a common ancestor are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghomostr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghomostr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">homologous structures</a>.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="14images/14-13.gif" width="500" height="269" ALT="Figure 14-13"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 14-13<br>The forelimbs of all mammals consist of the same skeletal parts. The hypothesis that all mammals descended from a common ancestor predicts that their forelimbs would be variations of the structural form in that ancestor.</span></td>

						</table></p>

<p>Homologous structures support other evidence that evolution is a remodeling process. Structures that originally functioned one way in ancestral species become modified as they take on new functions. This idea is what Darwin meant by "descent with modification." The limitations of this retrofitting are evident in structures that are less than perfect. For example, almost no person reaches old age without some form of knee or back problem. The human spine and knee joint were derived from ancestral structures that supported four-legged mammals&#151;not two-legged mammals that walked upright.</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting homologous structures are those that have a major function in one species but are not important in a related species. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvestigi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvestigi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vestigial structures</a> (ves TIJ ee uhl) are remnants of structures that may have had important functions in an ancestral species, but have no clear function in some of the modern descendants. Often, vestigial organs are reduced in size. For example, the whales of today lack hind limbs, but some have small vestigial hipbones probably derived from their four-footed ancestors described earlier. Lamarck's idea of <i>inheritance of acquired characteristics</i> (see Concept 14.1) could account for the reduced size of vestigial structures. However, genetic evidence does not support such a process of inheritance. Natural selection provides a different explanation for vestigial structures that is consistent with known processes of inheritance. Natural selection would favor the survival and reproduction of individuals with genes for reduced versions of those structures. Consider also that if species arose independently, remnants of structures similar to working organs in other species would be unlikely. But the presence of these structures makes sense if certain species descended from a common ancestor.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Similarities in Development</span><br>
Other clues to evolutionary history come from comparing the development of different organisms. Embryos of closely related organisms often have similar stages in development. All vertebrates, for example, have an embryonic stage in which pouches appear on the sides of the throat. At this stage, the embryos of fishes, frogs, snakes, birds, and primates look relatively alike. These different vertebrates take on more distinctive features as development progresses. In fishes, for example, most of the throat pouches develop into gills. In land vertebrates, however, these embryonic features are involved in the development of other structures, such as bones of the skull. Yet, the similarities of these structures during development support other evidence that all vertebrates evolved from a common ancestor.</p>

<p>Comparing the development of organisms supports other evidence of homologous structures. The forelimbs of the mammals described earlier are an example. As the skeletons of the forelimbs take form in the embryos of different mammals, there is a common pattern in the development of many bones. Structural differences become clear later in development. The specific type of limb is shaped by differences in the rates at which different bones of the skeleton grow. This evidence further supports the hypothesis that all mammals are related and descended, with modification, from a common ancestor.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Molecular Biology</span><br>
In recent decades, biologists have been reading a molecular history of evolution in the DNA sequences of organisms. The sequences of bases in DNA molecules are passed from parents to offspring. As you learned in Chapter 11, these DNA sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins. These information-rich molecules are the records of an organism's ancestry (hereditary background). Among siblings, the DNA and protein sequences are very similar. However, the sequences of unrelated individuals of the same species show more differences.</p>

<p>This idea of molecular comparison extends to studying relationships between species. If two species have genes and proteins with sequences that match closely, biologists conclude that the sequences must have been inherited from a relatively recent common ancestor. In contrast, the greater the number of differences in DNA and protein sequences between species, the less likely they share as close a common ancestry.</p>

<p>Testable hypotheses are at the heart of science. DNA and protein analyses are new tools for testing hypotheses about evolution. For example, fossil evidence and studies of anatomy support the hypothesis that humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are closely related. This hypothesis is testable. It can be used to make predictions about what to expect if the hypothesis is correct. For example, <i>if</i> humans and other primates are closely related, <i>then</i> they should share much of their inherited DNA and protein sequences. The sequences of distantly related species should have more differences. If molecular analysis did not confirm this prediction, that would cast doubt on the hypothesis that apes and humans are closely related.</p>

<p>Figure 14-16 compares the amino acid sequence of human hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in blood) with the hemoglobin of other vertebrates. The data support the hypothesis that humans are more closely related to primates than to other vertebrates. Other evidence comes from DNA sequences in humans and chimpanzees. There is approximately 5 percent difference in the total DNA between these two species.</p>

<p>Darwin's boldest hypothesis was that all life forms are related. The molecular evidence includes the common genetic code shared by all species (Chapter 11). This genetic language has been passed along through all the branches of evolution. And, it has added to the evidence that supports evolution as an explanation for the unity and diversity of life.</p>
