<p>What could animals as different as a blue whale and the tiny lancelet shown below possibly have in common? Both organisms belong to the phylum known as chordates. In this section, you'll explore the unique features shared by all chordates&#151;including you.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Characteristics of Chordates</span><br>
The animals known as the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchordat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchordat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chordates</a> (phylum Chordata) are named for a structure that is found in all chordate embryos. This structure, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnotocho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnotocho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">notochord</a>, is a flexible rod that extends through much of the length of the body (Figure 25-1). Chordates include two groups of invertebrates as well as all of the vertebrate animals. (Recall from Chapter 23 that vertebrates are animals with segmented backbones like your own.) In some invertebrate chordates, the notochord remains as the skeleton in the adult animals. In vertebrates, however, only remnants of the notochord remain&#151;such as the discs of cartilage in your backbone. </p>

<p>In addition to a notochord, all chordate embryos also share three other distinctive features. The first is a hollow nerve cord located along the dorsal (back) side of the animal. This hollow nerve cord develops into the brain and the spinal cord. In contrast, non-chordates have either no nerve cord or a solid nerve cord that usually runs along the ventral (front) side.</p>

<p>All chordate embryos also have slits located in the pharynx, the region of the digestive tube just behind the mouth. In vertebrates that keep these pharyngeal slits as adults, water enters the organism's mouth and exits through the slits, without traveling through the entire digestive system. In some invertebrate chordates these slits filter water for suspended food. In other groups of vertebrates, the pharyngeal slits and surrounding structures develop into different organs, including organs for gas exchange (gills), jaw support, hearing, and other functions.</p>

<p>The final distinguishing characteristic of chordate embryos is a tail that extends beyond the anus. In many chordates, the tail contains backbone segments and muscles. The tail provides much of the force that enables aquatic chordates to swim.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Invertebrate Chordates</span><br>
Invertebrate chordates illustrate the chordate body structure in its simplest form. There are two main groups of invertebrate chordates: the tunicates and the lancelets. Tunicates are marine animals that look like small sacs. The adults are sessile and often attach to rocks, the underside of boats, or coral reefs. They filter seawater through their pharyngeal slits and feed on small organic particles suspended in the water. Adult tunicates have no trace of a notochord, nerve cord, or tail. However, the tunicate larva is a swimming, tadpole-like organism with all four chordate features.</p>

<p>Lancelets, such as the one in Figure 25-1, are small (5-15 cm), blade-like chordates that resemble tunicate larvae. They live in the sand on the ocean floor and filter tiny food particles from seawater.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Vertebrates</span><br>
Vertebrates make up most of the phylum Chordata. Figure 25-3 illustrates two unique features of vertebrates: a skull and a backbone. These skeletal features protect the main parts of the animal's nervous system. The skull forms a hard case for the brain. The backbone is composed of a series of skeletal segments called <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvertebr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvertebr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">vertebrae</a> (singular, <i>vertebra</i>), which enclose the nerve cord. In addition to the skull and vertebrae, most vertebrates have skeletal parts (such as shoulders and a pelvis) that support paired limbs (such as pairs of legs).</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The vertebrate skeleton is inside the animal's body and is therefore called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gendoske.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gendoske.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">endoskeleton</a>. In some vertebrates, such as sharks, the endoskeleton is made entirely of flexible cartilage&#151;the same material that makes up your outer ear. In other vertebrates, such as humans and other mammals, the skeleton is a combination of hard bone and cartilage. Bone and cartilage are mostly nonliving material, but they do contain living cells that secrete new bone or cartilage. These living cells enable the endoskeleton to grow with the animal. Contrast this with an arthropod's nonliving exoskeleton, which must be shed (molted) as the organism outgrows it.</p>

<p>Almost all vertebrates have an important feeding adaptation&#151;a hinged jaw. Not having hinged jaws limits the size and shape of an animal's food and the ability to begin processing food by chewing. For example, think about trying to eat an apple if your mouth were 3 centimeters in diameter and you could not chew. The evolution of hinged jaws enabled vertebrates to capture and eat a wide variety of prey.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Overview of Vertebrate Diversity</span><br>
The cladogram in Figure 25-4 is based on one set of  hypotheses for the evolutionary history of living vertebrates. To construct this diagram, biologists relied on a combination of anatomical, molecular, and fossil evidence. The branching points represent important developments in vertebrate evolution.</p>


					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="25images/25-04.gif" width="525" height="591" ALT="Figure 25-4"></td>

						</table></p>


<p>The first two branches near the bottom of the diagram lead to two animal groups thought to be most closely related to the ancestors of vertebrates: hagfishes and lampreys. Both of these classes of vertebrates are aquatic animals that at first glance look something like eels. They are not closely related to eels, however. Both lampreys and hagfishes lack the hinged jaws and paired limbs found in all other vertebrates. Lampreys have a cartilage skeleton that is more complex than a hagfish's cartilage skeleton. Although hagfishes have skulls, they do not have vertebrae: Their main body support is an adult version of the embryo's notochord. This primitive skeleton is one reason many biologists consider hagfishes to be the closest living relatives of the invertebrate chordates that were the ancestors of vertebrates.</p>

<p>As you have read, all vertebrates other than lampreys and hagfishes have hinged jaws. Evidence from fossils and the study of embryos indicates that hinged jaws evolved from some of the skeletal supports of pharyngeal slits. Included among jawed vertebrates are the various classes of aquatic, finned animals generally called fishes. (Note that the term <i>fish</i> is the plural when referring to several of one species of fish, such as several sharks of the same species. However, the plural <i>fishes</i> is used when referring to more than one species, such as tuna and sharks.)</p>

<p>All other jawed vertebrates are <i>tetrapods,</i> a term that means "four-footed." The tetrapods include the amphibians (frogs and salamanders), the animals traditionally called reptiles (turtles, lizards, snakes, and crocodiles), birds, and mammals. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtetrapo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtetrapo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tetrapod</a> has two sets of paired limbs that are modified as legs that can support the animal. An example is a crocodile. This adaptation made it possible for vertebrates to inhabit the land, another key development in the evolution of vertebrates. Some tetrapods, however, adapted to their environments by becoming legless. For example, snakes are considered tetrapods because they most likely evolved from a four-legged ancestor. The rest of this chapter focuses on fishes and amphibians.</p>
