<p>In Greek, the word <i>amphibios</i> means "living a double life." Most amphibians exhibit a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial adaptations. While spending much of their adult life on land, most amphibians return to water to reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Origin of Tetrapods</span><br>
Amphibians (class Amphibia) are tetrapods. They were the first vertebrates with adaptations for living on land. But before amphibians resembling the frogs and salamanders of today, there were other four-limbed ancestors that were fully aquatic and more like fish with sturdy legs. These earliest tetrapods lived in shallow aquatic habitats about 400 to 350 million years ago, during the Devonian period.</p>

<p>During this period, a diversity of plants and arthropods already inhabited the land. Some organic material from these terrestrial ecosystems dropped into aquatic habitats. This created new living conditions and food supplies for fishes living near the water's edge. A diversity of fishes resembling modern lobe-finned fishes and lungfishes had already evolved. In addition, limbs and lungs evolved in certain fishes that scientists hypothesize included the ancestors of terrestrial vertebrates. Leg-like limbs may have allowed these animals to paddle and crawl through the dense vegetation in shallow water, and could also support their weight as they moved onto land. Lungs might have supplemented gills for more efficient gas exchange at the water's edge.</p>

<p>Fossils record this transition to life on land over a 50-million-year period. For example, the fossils of the early tetrapod <i>Acanthostega</i> have the bony supports of gills, like a fish, but also have four legs (Figure 25-13). The skeletal parts of <i>Acanthostega's</i> legs are similar to the skeletal parts of the limbs of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, including humans. </p>

<p>The lush swamps and forests of the Carboniferous period (350 to 280 million years ago) provided an ideal habitat for early amphibians. In fact, they became so widespread that the Carboniferous period is sometimes called the Age of Amphibians. As the Carboniferous swamps and forests declined, about 300 million years ago, so did those early amphibians. Many evolutionary branches became extinct. Some gave rise to modern amphibians, and another gave rise to the reptiles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Amphibians</span><br>
Many <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gamphibi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gamphibi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">amphibians</a> live part of their life cycle in water and part on land. In general, the larval stage lives in water, while the adult stage lives on land. Amphibian adults generally utilize lungs to breathe air; have a smooth, moist skin; and lack scales.</p>

<p>The eggs of amphibians do not have shells and dry out quickly in the air. For this reason, most amphibians are tied to water because that is where they lay their eggs. The eggs hatch and develop into larvae called tadpoles. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtadpole.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtadpole.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Tadpoles</a> are generally legless aquatic plant eaters with gills; a lateral line system resembling that of fishes; and a long, finned tail. In developing into adults, tadpoles undergo a dramatic metamorphosis, or change in body form. When young adults crawl onto shore, most species have four legs, air-breathing lungs instead of gills, a pair of external eardrums, and no lateral line system. Because of metamorphosis, many amphibians truly live a double life, first in water and then on land. However, there is great diversity among amphibians. Some species do not have a terrestrial stage, while other species do not have an aquatic stage.</p>

<p>The smooth skin of adult amphibians is generally moist and often serves to supplement their lungs for gas exchange. Amphibian skin usually has mucous glands as well as poison glands that often play a role in defense against predators.</p>

<p>In contrast to the two-chambered heart of fishes, the amphibian heart has three chambers (Figure 25-15). One chamber (the ventricle) pumps blood away from the heart, and the blood then divides into two pathways of vessels. One pathway delivers blood to the lungs and skin for gas exchange through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The other pathway transports blood to the rest of the body. The remaining two chambers (the atria) collect blood that is returning to the heart&#151;one atrium for each circulatory path. This two-circuit circulation makes it possible for oxygen-rich blood to be more efficiently transported to the brain, muscles, and other organs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Amphibians</span><br>
Today there are about 4,800 species of amphibians. The world's oldest surviving class of tetrapods accounts for only about 8 percent of today's vertebrates. Amphibians can be divided into three orders: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians (see SIL ee unz).</p>


<p><span class="setextsubsm">Frogs</span> Due to their great diversity (4,200 known species) and widespread occurrence, frogs (order Anura, "tailless ones") are probably the amphibians most familiar to you. Most frogs have bulging eyes, a pair of external eardrums, no tail, strong hind legs, webbed feet, and smooth, moist skin (Figure 25-16). <i>Toad</i> is a term generally used to refer to frogs that have rough skin and live entirely in terrestrial environments. Frogs mainly eat insects and catch them by flicking out their long, sticky tongues. Some frogs eat other frogs and small rodents. For defense from predators, frogs rely on camouflage and glands on the skin that secrete toxins. In contrast to camouflaged frogs, the vivid colors of the most poisonous species warn predators to "stay away." Frogs are usually quiet creatures. However, during breeding season, many species will fill the air with their mating calls.</p>

The vivid coloration of these poisonous frogs is an adaptation that warns away potential predators.</span></td>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Salamanders</span> Worldwide, there are only about 500 species of salamanders (order Urodela, "tailed ones"). Most salamanders and the closely related newts do not lose their tail as they develop into adults. Usually, salamander bodies are long and slender. Instead of jumping like frogs, salamanders scurry about on all four equal-sized legs. The side-to-side style of walking exhibited by some salamanders is thought to be similar to the way early terrestrial tetrapods walked. Some species of salamanders live in aquatic environments, while other species live entirely in terrestrial habitats. Some terrestrial species do not have lungs. Instead they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment entirely through their thin, moist skin and mouth lining.</p>

<p>Salamanders are mainly meat eaters that eat insects and other small invertebrates. In the forest soils of eastern North America, salamanders have a big impact on the ecosystem. The salamanders that inhabit even relatively small sections of forest habitat can consume tons of insects each year.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Caecilians</span> There are about 150 species of caecilians (order Apoda, "legless ones"), amphibians that are legless and nearly blind. Caecilians evolved from an ancestor that had legs. The legless adaptation is a clue to their habitat. Like earthworms, most caecilians inhabit burrows in moist soil. The reduced limbs of caecilians are adaptations to a burrowing lifestyle. A few South American caecilians have adapted to freshwater ponds and streams.</p>

<p>Compared to fishes, amphibians exhibit evolutionary changes that enabled them to inhabit the land for at least part of their life cycles. Further evolutionary adaptations in vertebrates are evident in "reptiles," birds, and mammals&#151;vertebrates that filled diverse land habitats. These vertebrate groups quickly became the dominant large animals on land and continue their success today. Their story is the subject of the next chapter.</p>
