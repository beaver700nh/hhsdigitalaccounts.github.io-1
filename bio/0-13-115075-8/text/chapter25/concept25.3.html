<p>There are more species of bony fishes than of any other single group of vertebrates. Ranging in size from about 1 centimeter to more than 6 meters long, bony fishes are common in nearly all marine and freshwater habitats.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Bony Fishes</span><br>
Bony fishes have a relatively stiff skeleton reinforced by hard calcium compounds. Like sharks and rays, bony fishes have gills that extract oxygen from the surrounding water. On each side of the head of bony fishes, a protective flap called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gopercul.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gopercul.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">operculum</a> (plural, <i>operculi</i>) covers a chamber housing the gills. Movement of the operculum pumps water through the gills and allows the fish to obtain oxygen from the water even when it is not swimming. The sharks you read about in Concept 25.2 lack operculi, which is why they must swim or use jaw and pharyngeal muscles to continuously pump water over their gills for gas exchange.</p>

<p>Like sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system, a keen sense of smell, and good eyesight. Flattened, stiff scales made of bone often cover the skin. Glands in the skin secrete a slimy mucus that helps fishes glide more easily through the water. The "limbs" of fishes include paired front fins and hind fins, which help maneuver their bodies when swimming. Like sharks and rays, most bony fishes are carnivores. Many species, however, feed on plankton or algae, such as seaweed.</p>

<p>Two key internal features of bony fishes are an air sac and a two-chambered heart (Figure 25-10). In most fishes, the air sac functions as a "swim bladder," which makes the animal more buoyant. The air sac also aids "hearing" in many fishes by transmitting vibrations to sensory organs. And some fishes, including lungfishes, use their air sacs as respiratory organs that supplement the gills' exchange of gases with the environment.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>In the two-chambered heart of a bony fish, one chamber (the ventricle) pumps blood to the gills and the other chamber (the atrium) receives blood returning from the entire body. The blood takes up oxygen as it passes through the gills and then unloads that oxygen as it passes through other organs on its way back to the heart. This single-circuit pathway for blood flow in fishes delivers oxygen to tissues much more slowly than does the more complex circulatory systems of land-dwelling vertebrates such as frogs. But, compared to land-living vertebrates of the same size, fishes require less oxygen because they have a lower rate of metabolism.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Bony Fishes</span><br>
Until recently, all bony fishes were grouped together in class Osteichthyes. Most biologists now recognize three separate classes of bony fishes: ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii), lobe-finned fishes (class Actinistia), and lungfishes (class Dipnoi).</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ray-Finned Fishes</span> There are more than 20,000 species of Actinopterygii. Most bony fishes, including trout, bass, perch, and tuna, are ray-finned fishes. Ray-finned fishes are named for their fins, which consist of webs of skin supported by bony rays or spines. The thin, flexible fins help fishes maneuver while swimming. They are also used by some fishes for defense from predators.</p>

<p>In most ray-finned fishes, the air sac is adapted as a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gswimbla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gswimbla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">swim bladder</a>, which is an organ that regulates buoyancy. This swim bladder is a gas-filled sac that enables a fish to control its density and thereby its depth in the water. Because of the swim bladder, bony fishes can remain motionless in water without sinking, unlike most sharks.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Lobe-Finned Fishes</span> In contrast to the ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes have muscular fins supported by stout bones. Lobe-finned fishes  are not common today and are known mainly from the fossil record. Many fossil lobe-finned fishes from the Devonian period (about 400&#150;350 million years ago) were large and apparently lived and fed on the bottom of shallow, freshwater habitats. They may have used their muscular fins to "walk" along the bottom of bodies of water. The only lobe-finned fishes to survive today are the coelacanths (SEE luh kanths). Coelacanths are found in the deep waters off the coast of Madagascar and Indonesia.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Lungfishes</span> The third class of bony fishes are lungfishes. Today, lungfishes can be found on continents in the Southern Hemisphere. They generally inhabit still ponds and swamps. The air sac of a lungfish branches into two lobes that function as lungs. A network of tiny blood vessels around the lungs take oxygen from the air that the fish gulps in when it comes to the surface of the water. Lungfishes also have gills that enable the animals to obtain oxygen from water.</p>

<p>The precise relationship between lungfishes and lobe-finned fishes is an area of continuing research. During the Devonian period, lungfishes were abundant predators in shallow, freshwater habitats. Recent analysis of molecular and fossil data point to lungfishes as the living fishes most closely related to tetrapods (land-dwelling vertebrates with legs).</p>
