<p>Sharks have been hunting in the oceans for hundreds of millions of years. In addition to highly developed senses of touch, smell, hearing, vision, and taste, the shark has one sense you do not have. This "sixth" sense is the ability to detect small electric fields from a meter or more away. Since living organisms produce these small electric fields, this sense helps the shark find prey . . . one reason why some people call sharks "The Perfect Predator."</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Fishes</span><br>
Fishes, the first jawed vertebrates, make up about 30,000 of the more than 55,000 species of vertebrates on Earth today. There are two main groups of fishes. One group is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcartigi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcartigi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cartilaginous fishes</a>, class Chondrichthyes (kahn DRIK theez), so named because they have a flexible skeleton made entirely of cartilage. Cartilaginous fishes include the sharks and rays. All other fishes are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbonyfis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbonyfis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bony fishes</a> (formerly, class Osteichthyes (ohs tee IK theez), now divided into three classes) because their skeletons contain bone hardened by calcium compounds.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sharks</span><br>
Nearly all sharks live in marine habitats. Sharks have streamlined bodies and are swift swimmers. Powerful muscles in their tail propel them forward. The dorsal (back or top) fins function mainly as stabilizers. And the lateral (side) fins provide lift in the water. However, these fins are not very movable, and as a result sharks do not maneuver very well. A shark must swim constantly to avoid sinking, since its body is actually denser than water. Continual swimming also ensures that water flows into the shark's mouth and through its gills, enabling the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Some sharks spend time resting on the seafloor. When not swimming, they must use muscles in their jaws and pharynx to pump water over their gills.</p>

<p>Most sharks are predators&#151;fast and powerful with acute senses. Sharks have sharp eyesight, a powerful sense of smell, and highly developed electrosensor organs on their heads. These electrosensors can detect very small changes in electrical fields produced by muscle contractions in nearby animals. Sharks, as well as most other aquatic vertebrates, also have a <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glateral.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glateral.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lateral line system</a>, a row of sensory organs running along each side of the body. The lateral line system is sensitive to very small changes in water pressure. This enables a shark to "feel" minor vibrations caused by swimming animals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Rays</span><br>
Although rays are closely related to sharks, they have adapted to a very different lifestyle. Most rays are bottom-dwellers that feed by using their jaws to crush mollusks and crustaceans. Other rays cruise in open water, scooping food into their gaping mouths. A ray's front fins are greatly enlarged. These fins propel the animal through water much like a bird flaps its wings to move through air. The tail of many rays is whip-like and, in some species, has poisonous spines that function in defense. The largest of the rays is the manta ray, with a "wingspan" of up more than 7 meters. </p>
