<p>Earlier you read that some plants harbor bacteria in root nodules, providing a ready supply of nitrogen. And you read that many plant roots associate with fungi, allowing access to more water and phosphorus. Now you will read about some interesting ways that plants take advantage of other plants, and even animals, to meet their nutritional needs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Carnivorous Plants</span><br>
You know that many animals, including humans, obtain nutrients by eating plants. But did you know that a few plants obtain nutrients, especially nitrogen, by eating animals? Carnivorous (meat-eating) plants, including sundews, Venus' flytraps, and pitcher plants, obtain some of their nitrogen by consuming insects. The structures that carnivorous plants use to trap and digest their prey are usually modified leaves.</p>

<p>Why would a plant require nitrogen from animals? The bogs where most carnivorous plants live are wetland areas containing cold, acidic water. Organic matter decays slowly in these acidic environments, and there is little inorganic nitrogen available for plant growth. Some bog plants supplement their nitrogen intake by consuming nitrogen-rich insects. Note that carnivorous plants are green and still photosynthesize in addition to eating insects. They are both producers <i>and</i> consumers. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Epiphytes</span><br>
An <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gepiphyt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gepiphyt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">epiphyte</a> grows on the surface of another plant, usually on the branches or trunks of trees, but makes all its own food by photosynthesis. Epiphytes do not absorb water and minerals from soil but rather from rain containing dissolved nutrients that falls on their leaves. For example, the threadlike leaves of the epiphytic Spanish "moss" are covered with scales adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>

<p>Epiphytes often live in dense forests where light rarely penetrates to the forest floor. Growing on other plants brings epiphytes close to sunlight and puts them in the path of water dripping from foliage in the treetops. Examples of epiphytes are staghorn ferns, some mosses, Spanish "moss" (which is actually an angiosperm), and many species of bromeliads and orchids.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Parasitic Plants</span><br>
Parasitic plants obtain some or all of their nutrients from other plants by tapping into the host plant's vascular tissue. Epiphytes such as the Spanish "moss" in are not parasites&#151;they grow on other plants but do not steal from them. The most familiar example of a parasitic plant is mistletoe. A mistletoe seed germinates on branches of its host tree. It then grows through the bark and into the host's xylem, from which it takes both water and minerals. Mistletoe and other parasites may kill their hosts by blocking out sunlight or robbing too many nutrients.</p>

<p>While mistletoe makes some of its own food through photosynthesis, there are a few plant species that lack chlorophyll entirely and are therefore completely parasitic on other plants. Fortunately for humans and other consumers, the vast majority of plants are producers.</p>
