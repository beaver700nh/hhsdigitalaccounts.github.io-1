<p>From the outside a tree trunk appears silent and unmoving, hardly even alive. But there is much activity inside. If you place a stethoscope on a tree trunk, especially during early spring just before leaves appear, you might hear the whoosh of sap running through the tree. In this section, you will learn how plants move water and sugars in their vascular tissues.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Roots Absorb Water and Minerals</span><br>
You have learned that a plant's roots absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil. How does this work? <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/groothai.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/groothai.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Root hairs</a> are tiny outgrowths of the root's epidermal cells. These root hairs grow into the spaces between soil particles. They greatly increase the surface area available for absorbing water and dissolved minerals. In addition, recall from Chapter 18 that the roots of most vascular plants form an association with fungi called mycorrhizae. This association increases the ability of the root to absorb water and inorganic ions, especially phosphate. As much as 3 m of fungal hyphae (filaments) can extend from each centimeter along a root.</p>

<p>Once the water gets inside the root, two main forces operate (usually at different times of day) in moving water upward from the roots and throughout the plant. The first force, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grootprr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grootprr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">root pressure</a>, helps push water up the xylem and usually operates at night. The root's epidermal cells and ground tissue cells use energy from ATP to accumulate certain minerals. The minerals can then move from cell to cell through cytoplasmic channels. Water and minerals move via this pathway into the xylem. Surrounding the vascular tissue is a layer of cells called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gendoder.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gendoder.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">endodermis</a>, which has waxy cell walls. The wax prevents water and minerals from leaking back out of the xylem. As minerals accumulate in the xylem, water tends to enter by osmosis, pushing xylem sap upward ahead of it.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Upward Movement of Xylem Sap</span><br>
Root pressure only accounts for a small part of the sap's ascent. To get water to the top of the plant, another stronger force is involved. And rather than <i>push</i> water up the plant from the bottom, this force <i>pulls</i> it from the top. Drinking water with a straw is a useful analogy&#151;the suction you create at the top is a pulling force somewhat like the pulling force in plants. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtranspi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtranspi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Transpiration</a>, the loss of water through leaves due to evaporation, generates the pull (called <i>transpiration-pull</i>). Transpiration can pull xylem sap up a tree because of two properties of water that you learned about in Chapter 4: cohesion and adhesion.</p>

<p>Recall that cohesion is the tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick to one another. In water, hydrogen bonds make the water molecules stick to one another. The water molecules in the xylem tubes form continuous strings, extending all the way from the leaves down to the roots (Figure 21-7). Adhesion is the attraction between unlike molecules. Water molecules adhere, or stick to, cellulose molecules in the xylem walls. This assists the upward movement of xylem sap by counteracting the downward pull of gravity. Adhesion also prevents water from falling back down to the roots at night.</p>

<p>There are two types of xylem "straws" in which water travels through the plant, each composed of its own kind of cell. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachei.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachei.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Tracheids</a> are long cells with tapered ends. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvessel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvessel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vessel elements</a> are wider, shorter, much less tapered cells. The ends of tracheids or vessel elements overlap, forming tubes (Figure 21-8). The tubes are hollow because the cells have died. Only their lignified cell walls remain, creating the walls of the tubes. Water passes from cell to cell through pits in these cell walls and through openings in the end walls of vessel elements.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulating Water Loss</span><br>
Transpiration is required for the upward transport of water and minerals from the roots to the leaves. It also results in evaporative cooling. This prevents leaves from reaching temperatures that could denature enzymes important to photosynthesis. Yet, transpiration also causes a tremendous loss of water from the plant. An average-sized maple tree, for instance, loses more than 220 liters of water per hour during the summer. As long as water moves up from the soil fast enough to replace the water that is lost, this amount of transpiration presents no problem. But if transpiration exceeds the rate of water delivery to the leaves, the leaves will wilt. You have probably observed this result if you have ever forgotten to water a houseplant. A plant can withstand wilting for a short time, but eventually without a sufficient supply of water to the roots the plant will die. </p>

<p>Leaf stomata are adaptations that help plants regulate their transpiration and adjust to changing environmental conditions. Recall from Chapter 19 that stomata (singular, <i>stoma</i>) are pores located in the epidermis of leaves. The stomata can open and close, affecting the movement of gases in and out of the leaf. A pair of <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gguardce.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gguardce.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">guard cells</a> around each stoma open and close the stoma by changing shape (Figure 21-9). </p>

						</table></p>

<p>During the day the stomata of most plants are open, allowing carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis to enter. Sunlight and low carbon dioxide levels within the leaf cue the guard cells to actively accumulate potassium ions (K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) from surrounding cells. Due to osmosis, water follows the potassium ions into the guard cells, causing the guard cells to swell. The swollen guard cells buckle away from their centers in such a way that a gap (the stoma) opens between them.</p>

<p>Stomata typically close at night or when the plant is losing water from transpiration at a faster rate than it is gaining water from the soil. Potassium ions are lost from the guard cells, and water follows. The guard cells sag together as they lose water pressure, closing the stoma.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Flow of Phloem Sap</span><br> 
The phloem of vascular tissue transports sucrose and other organic compounds along with water. This stream of phloem sap occurs through chains of cells called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsievetu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsievetu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sieve-tube members</a>. They are named this because the end walls are like sieves, allowing the flow of the fluid through pores (Figure 21-10). The chain of end-to-end cells forms a <i>sieve tube.</i> In contrast to the xylem cells, sieve-tube members remain alive. However, as they mature, sieve-tube members lose their nuclei and some other organelles. This means they lose the ability to perform some of their necessary cellular functions. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcompani.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcompani.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Companion cells</a> alongside sieve tubes may provide proteins and other resources to the sieve-tube members.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">From Source to Sink</span> What determines the direction of movement for phloem sap within a sieve tube? Phloem moves sugars from where they are made to where they are used. The mature leaves or other sites where sugar is being produced by photosynthesis or released from storage are referred to as sugar sources. Phloem moves sugar from a sugar source to a part of the plant where the sugar will be used or stored, called a sugar sink. Roots, developing shoot tips, and fruits are examples of sugar sinks.</p>

<p>Within a plant, the location of sugar sources and sinks can change with the seasons. For example, some storage structures such as beet taproots or potato tubers are sugar sinks during the summer. These plants stockpile sugars (stored in polysaccharides such as starch) in these structures when growing conditions are favorable. During the early spring of the following year, these same structures become sugar sources. The plant consumes its stored carbohydrates as it produces new stems and leaves.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Pressure-Flow Mechanism</span> What drives movement of phloem sap? Plant biologists have tested a number of hypotheses. The hypothesis called the pressure-flow mechanism is widely accepted today.</p>

<p>When sugar is produced in a source such as a mature leaf, it is actively transported into a sieve-tube member of the phloem (Figure 21-11). This generates a high concentration of sugar at the source end of the phloem. Water follows the sugar into the phloem by osmosis. This generates higher water pressure at the source end than at the sink end of the phloem. The reverse happens at the sink end. Sugars leave the sieve-tube members, water follows, and pressure is reduced. Water, like any fluid, flows from where its pressure is higher to where it is lower. This process is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpressur.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpressur.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pressure-flow mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, the pressure-flow mechanism explains how sap flows through the phloem from areas of high sugar concentration and high water pressure to areas of low sugar concentration and low water pressure&#151;from source to sink. (The water is returned to the source via the xylem.)</p>
