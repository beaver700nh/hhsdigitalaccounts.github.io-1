<p>In the 4th century B.C.E., the philosopher and scientist Aristotle proposed that soil provides all the substance (mass) necessary for plant growth. Almost 2,000 years passed before his hypothesis was tested and rejected. The process of science often advances knowledge by rejecting old hypotheses and proposing new ones in their place.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Seeking the Source of a Plant's "Substance"</span><br>
Aristotle's idea was accepted as fact until the 1600s, when a Belgian physician named Jan Baptista van Helmont actually tested the hypothesis. Van Helmont grew a small willow tree in a pot containing 90 kilograms (kg) of soil. As the tree grew, he added nothing to the soil except water. Five years later, van Helmont found that the tree had gained nearly 75 kg while the soil had lost less than 0.1 kg (Figure 21-1). Since the tree gained far more mass than the soil lost, his data contradicted Aristotle's hypothesis that a plant gains its substance (mass) from soil. He proposed a new hypothesis: Growing plants gain substance from water added to the soil. A century after van Helmont's experiment, Stephen Hales, an English botanist, proposed a third hypothesis: Plants gain their substance from the air.</p>

<p>More recent research has indicated that there is some truth in all these early ideas about plant nutrition (Figure 21-2). Air supplies the plant with carbon dioxide. As you learned in Chapter 8, the carbon and oxygen of carbon dioxide are used in photosynthesis, generating sugar molecules. These sugars are the building blocks for the other organic molecules, such as cellulose, that make up the plant's tissues. Water (absorbed by the plant from the soil) supplies the hydrogen used in photosynthesis, serves as the solvent for the transport of other molecules through the plant, and makes up about 80-85 percent of a nonwoody plant's mass. Soil is the source of inorganic nutrients called minerals that are dissolved in water and absorbed by the plant's roots.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Mineral Requirements of Plants</span><br>
While many animals require a complex diet of large organic molecules, plants have simpler needs. In addition to air and water, plants require only simple ions from the soil to survive and grow. Combining these with the products of their photosynthesis, plants can make all the proteins, carbohydrates, and other molecules they need.</p>

<p>Most plants need 17 chemical elements to complete their life cycles&#151;that is, to grow from a seed and produce another generation of seeds. Three of these are not obtained as minerals from the soil, as you just read: Carbon and oxygen come from CO<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> in the air and hydrogen comes mainly from water in the soil. The other elements, however, are mineral nutrients absorbed in ionic form from the soil. Figure 21-3 lists six of the mineral nutrients plants require in greatest abundance, along with their functions in the plant.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Like animals, plants can suffer from nutritional deficiencies. Without proper nutrition, plant growth may be stunted or the plant may fail to flower. Stems, roots, and leaves may also die. A plant that is magnesium-deficient, for example, is unable to synthesize chlorophyll, and shows a yellowing of its young leaves.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Closer Look at Nitrogen</span><br> 
Nitrogen is a particularly important plant nutrient because it is often in limited supply in a plant's environment. A plant uses nitrogen to produce proteins, nucleic acids, and hormones. With nitrogen making up nearly 80 percent of the atmosphere, why do many plants suffer from nitrogen deficiencies? The problem is that atmospheric nitrogen (N<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>) is a gaseous form of nitrogen that plants can't use. Plants must absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of mineral ions (Figure 21-4).</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="21images/21-04.gif" width="525" height="312" ALT="Figure 21-4"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 21-4<br>Bacteria help convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium and nitrate ions, forms of nitrogen that plants can use.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>For plants to absorb nitrogen from the soil, the nitrogen must first be converted to ammonium ions (NH<span class="sub"><sub>4</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) or nitrate ions (NO<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>&#150;</sup></span>). Certain species of soil bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen (N<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>) to ammonia (NH<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span>) in a process called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnitroge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnitroge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nitrogen fixation</a>. Each NH<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span> molecule picks up another hydrogen ion from the soil, becoming NH<span class="sub"><sub>4</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>. Other bacteria called ammonifying bacteria also contribute ammonia to the soil by breaking down organic material such as feces and dead leaves. A third group of bacteria called nitrifying bacteria convert NH<span class="sub"><sub>4</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions to NO<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>&#150;</sup></span>. </p>

<p>Many nitrogen-fixing bacteria live freely in the soil. However, you can see that a plant adaptation that concentrates this nitrogen-fixing power close to the roots would be beneficial. In fact, some plants, including plants called <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glegume.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glegume.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">legumes</a>, such as peas, peanuts, alfalfa, and beans, house their own nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria are found in lumps on the legumes' roots, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grootnod.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grootnod.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">root nodules</a>. The relationship between the legume and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria usually benefits both organisms. The bacteria fix nitrogen, while the plant provides carbohydrates and other organic nutrients to the bacteria.</p>

<p>Farmers use this adaptation of legumes to improve their fields in the practice of crop rotation. A field that is planted with a non-legume crop, such as corn, gets depleted of nitrogen. But if the farmer plants a legume the following year, the soil's nitrogen supply will be replenished. The farmer can rotate the crops on a yearly basis, maximizing the quality of the soil and the crops.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Fertilizers</span><br>
Most farmers in the United States and other industrialized countries use commercially produced fertilizers containing minerals. These fertilizers are usually enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the three mineral nutrients most commonly deficient in farm and garden soils. The next time you're in a garden shop, take a minute to examine the sacks of various fertilizers. You'll see that each one has a three-number code. A fertilizer marked "10-12-8," for instance, is 10 percent nitrogen, 12 percent phosphorus, and 8 percent potassium.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, any minerals from commercial fertilizers in excess of what crops need are not stored in the soil for later use. They are usually wasted because they are leached from the soil by rainwater or irrigation, and may end up polluting groundwater, streams, and lakes. Rotating crops is one way to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use. There are also some advantages in using mulch or manure instead of industrial fertilizers because they release the minerals more gradually.</p>
