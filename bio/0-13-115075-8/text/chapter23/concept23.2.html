<p>Have you ever used a "natural sponge" to mop up a spill or wash a car? You might be surprised to learn that these large, fluffy brown sponges are actually the remains of aquatic animals.
</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Body of a Sponge</span><br>
Sponges (phylum Porifera) are the simplest animals. For example, <i>Scypha</i>, a small marine sponge measuring only a few centimeters, resembles a simple tube with an opening at one end (Figure 23-4). Unlike most animals, <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsponge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsponge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sponges</a> lack true tissues and organs. Most of the different types of cells in a sponge are relatively unspecialized.</p>

<p>The body of most sponges consists of two layers of cells separated by a jelly-like material. The outer layer of cells protects the interior of the sponge and also has many pores (holes) through which water can enter the sponge. The inner layer of cells lines the central cavity of the sponge. These cells, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcollarc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcollarc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">collar cells</a>, have flagella. Wandering through the jelly-like material are cells called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gamoeboc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gamoeboc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">amoebocytes</a> that pick up food from the collar cells, digest it, and carry the nutrients to other cells. Amoebocytes also transport oxygen, dispose of wastes, and can change into other cell types, such as support structures. In some sponges these support structures are rigid. In other types of sponges the structures are composed of a flexible protein called spongin. It is these flexible sponges that are harvested for use as bath sponges.</p>

<p>Sponges ingest food by the action of their collar cells. The flagella of collar cells generate water currents that move water through the sponge's pores and into the central cavity. As water flows through the sponge's body, it is filtered for food particles (mostly bacteria) in the water. Collar cells trap the food particles in mucus. Amoebocytes then engulf the particles and transport them to other cells. The water drawn in through the pores exits through the large opening at one end of the sponge.</p>

<p>Sponges live singly or in clusters formed by budding. Budding is a form of asexual reproduction in which new sponges develop from an outgrowth of the parent organism. Most species of sponges have great powers of regeneration. Small fragments of a sponge body can grow into an entire new sponge. However, sponges can also reproduce sexually. Most sponges have both male and female gamete-producing structures in the same organism. The union of egg and sperm cells form zygotes that develop into flagellated larvae.</p>

<p>Adult sponges are <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsessile.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsessile.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sessile</a>, meaning they are anchored in place. They can't run and hide. Sponges have chemical defenses that protect them from possible predators, disease organisms, and parasites. These defenses include toxins that keep predators from eating the sponges and powerful antibiotics that fight bacterial infections. Researchers are studying these unique sponge chemicals for new drugs to fight human disease.</p>

<p>Although sponges are animals, they have several protist-like features. Their relatively simple structure supports evidence from DNA analysis that sponges evolved very early from the protists that were ancestral to the animal kingdom. The modern protists that are most closely related to animals are colonies of protist cells that are very similar to the collar cells of sponges. Later in the chapter, you will learn about a hypothesis for how such colonial protists may have given rise to the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Sponges</span><br>
The 9,000 known species of sponges are diverse in shape, size, and color. Some sponges consist of a single cylinder, while other sponges branch out irregularly over the seafloor or lake bottoms. Some sponges, like <i>Scypha</i>, are quite small. Others can reach heights of 2 meters.</p>
