<p>You know an animal when you see one&#151;or do you? Can you explain why sea anemones or sea stars in a tide pool are considered animals? This chapter begins by helping you answer this question.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">What Is an Animal?</span><br>
More than a million living species of animals are organized into about 35 major groups (phyla). (Different biologists have different views on the exact number of animal phyla.) But as diverse as they are, animals share four key characteristics that taken together separate them from other organisms (Figure 23-1).</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Animals are eukaryotic.<br>
<b>2.</b> Animal cells lack cell walls.<br>
<b>3.</b> Animals are multicellular.<br>
<b>4.</b> Animals are heterotrophs that ingest food.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="23images/23-01.gif" width="430" height="220" ALT="Figure 23-1"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 23-1<br>A sea anemone may look like a plant, but is classified as an animal because it has all four key characteristics outlined in this table.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The fourth characteristic refers to how animals obtain nutrition. Most animals take food into their bodies and digest it there, like you do. This mode of nutrition, called ingestion, distinguishes animals from other heterotrophs, such as fungi, that digest food outside their bodies and then absorb the nutrients. In addition, most animals have a digestive cavity, an internal sac or tube in which digestion occurs.</p>

<p>The life cycles of most animals are also different from those of other organisms, especially in the early stages of development. You can note some of these characteristics of development in the life cycle of a sea star (Figure 23-2). Adult male and female animals produce haploid gametes by meiosis. During fertilization an egg and a sperm fuse and form a zygote. The zygote then undergoes mitosis. The first several cell divisions lead to an embryonic stage called a blastula that is common to all animals. Typically the <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gblastul.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gblastul.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">blastula</a> consists of a single layer of cells surrounding a hollow cavity. Later, in many animals, one side of the blastula folds inward, forming an embryonic stage called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggastrul.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggastrul.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gastrula</a>. The gastrula has both an outer and an inner cell layer.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="485" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align=center">

									<td align="center"><img src="23images/23-02.gif" width="485" height="493" ALT="Figure 23-2"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 23-2<br>The life cycle of a sea star serves as an example of animal development. Most animals begin development when the zygote divides repeatedly and forms a blastula. Some animals, such as the sea star, first develop into a larva and then undergo metamorphosis. Other animals develop directly into the adult form.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>From the gastrula stage, many animals develop directly into adults. But others, including the sea star, first go through one or more larval stages. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glarva.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glarva.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">larva</a> is an immature form of an animal that looks different from the adult form and usually eats different food. The larva undergoes a change of body form, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmetamor.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmetamor.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">metamorphosis</a>, and becomes an adult.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Invertebrates and Vertebrates</span><br>
One common way to group various animals is based on whether they have a backbone. If you examined a tide pool or the underside of rocks on a stream bottom, you would find yourself in the world of <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginverte.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginverte.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">invertebrates</a>, animals without backbones. Invertebrates make up approximately 95 percent of the different kinds of animals on Earth. Most invertebrate animals live in aquatic or moist terrestrial habitats. And the majority of aquatic invertebrate species live in marine waters. Some familiar examples of invertebrates include sea stars, jellies ("jellyfish"), snails, clams, insects, and worms.</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvertate.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvertate.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vertebrates</a>, animals with backbones, are well represented in terrestrial environments but also live in marine and freshwater habitats. Examples of common vertebrates are fishes, frogs, snakes, dogs, and the classmates sitting next to you. Since humans are land-dwelling vertebrates, it is natural that you would be most familiar with vertebrates. However, for every known vertebrate species, there are at least 19 known invertebrate species.</p>

<p>The diversity of invertebrates is the main subject of this chapter. In each of the following concepts, you will read about a different phylum of invertebrates. First, you will read about the general characteristics of the phylum. Then you will get a sense of the diversity of the animals within this group. Finally, at the end of this chapter, you will find a table that summarizes and compares information about how basic life processes are accomplished across all these invertebrate phyla.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Concept Check 23.1</span><br>
		<b>1.</b> What distinguishes an animal from animal-like protists (protozoans)?<br>
		<b>2.</b> Contrast invertebrates with vertebrates.<br>
		<b>3.</b> Explain the difference between the blastula and gastrula stages of development in most animals.<br>
