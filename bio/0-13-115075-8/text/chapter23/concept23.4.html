<p>The group of animals described here has a more complex body structure than the cnidarians. This structure enables the organism to move forward (headfirst) in response to stimuli such as prey. An example is a planarian, a small, flat organism that looks a little "cross-eyed."</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Body of a Flatworm</span><br>
Planarians are examples of the mostly small, leaflike or ribbonlike <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gflatwor.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gflatwor.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">flatworms</a> (phylum Platyhelminthes [plat i HEL minth ez]). In contrast to radially symmetrical animals such as cnidarians, flatworms, like most other animals, are bilaterally symmetrical. An animal with <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbilaters.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbilaters.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bilateral symmetry</a> has mirror-image right and left sides. A bilaterally symmetrical animal has a distinct head, or anterior end, and tail, or posterior end. It also has a back (dorsal) surface, a bottom (ventral) surface, and two side (lateral) surfaces. In most bilateral animals the eyes and other sense organs are located up front, on the head.</p> 

<p>Flatworms are the simplest animals to have three tissue layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (Figure 23-9). During an animal's early development, the ectoderm develops into the body covering, the mesoderm develops into an internal tissue-filled region, and the endoderm develops into the digestive sac. Like cnidarians, most flatworms have a digestive sac (gastrovascular cavity). The sac is highly branched, with a single mouth opening at one end. Food enters and wastes exit from this one opening located on the ventral surface of the planarian. When the animal is feeding, a muscular tube projects through the mouth and sucks in food.</p>

<p>Flatworms can move in several ways. For example, using cilia on its ventral surface, the planarian slides about in search of food. It also has muscles that enable it to twist and turn. The flatworm nervous system is also more complex and centralized than that of cnidarians. A planarian's head has a pair of eyespots that detect light and side flaps that function mainly for smell.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Flatworms</span><br>
The 20,000 known species of flatworms are divided into three classes. Planarians belong to the class Turbellaria. This group is mostly free-living (non-parasitic) and marine, but some planarians live in moist terrestrial environments. Flukes (class Trematoda) are parasites&#151;they are heterotrophs that absorb nutrients from the body fluids of a living host and in the process harm the host. For example, a blood fluke called <i>Schistosoma</i> infects humans and causes a severe, long-lasting disease called schistosomiasis (blood fluke disease). Most flukes have a complex life cycle that includes more than one host (Figure 23-10).</p>

								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 23-10<br>The life cycle of the parasitic blood fluke requires two hosts.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>Tapeworms (class Cestoidea) are also parasitic. Adult tapeworms such as <i>Taenia solium</i>, the pork tapeworm, live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates. The tapeworm itself has no digestive or circulatory system. Surrounded by partially digested food in their hosts' intestines, tapeworms absorb nutrients across their body surface. Each segment of the tapeworm contains reproductive organs that produce eggs.</p>
