<p>On a warm, sunny day in the tropics you might see thousands of harmless-looking blue bubbles floating on the surface of the ocean. Those bubbles are the top portion of a fascinating marine animal, the Portuguese man-of-war. Its tentacles extend as far as 50 meters below the surface of each bubble. Each tentacle contains stinging cells that cause a painful, temporarily paralyzing effect on fishes and other animals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Body of a Cnidarian</span><br>
The Portuguese man-of-war is common in both tropical and temperate climates and belongs to a phylum called Cnidaria (ny DAYR ee uh). Another cnidarian, the hydra, is commonly found in ponds and lakes. The hydra has a cylindrical body, about 3 cm long, with projections called tentacles at one end (Figure 23-6). Other cnidarians include the jellies (jellyfishes), sea anemones, and coral animals. Two characteristics that all <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcnidari.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcnidari.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cnidarians</a> share are radial symmetry and tentacles with stinging cells.</p>

<p>An organism with <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gradials.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gradials.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">radial symmetry</a> has body parts arranged like pieces of a pie around an imaginary central axis. Any imaginary slice passing longitudinally through the central axis of such an organism divides it into identical pieces. Animals with radial symmetry lack a head. Most cnidarians are slow-moving or sessile (attached to a surface). Most of the time these animals can be found on shallow ocean floors, or on the bottom of ponds, drifting about in water currents.</p>

<p>All cnidarians have specialized stinging cells used for defense and capturing prey. The phylum is named for these stinging cells, which are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcnidocy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcnidocy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cnidocytes</a> (NY duh syts). Cnidocytes are especially abundant along the tentacles. A stinging capsule is located within each cnidocyte.</p> 

<p>One type of capsule, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnematoc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnematoc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nematocyst</a>, contains a fine, coiled tubule that often has a poisonous barb at the end (Figure 23-7). When released, the barb from this type of nematocyst can penetrate and release poison into the prey. Tubules of some cnidarian species have barbed ends, while tubules from other species are sticky and wrap around the prey. The speed with which a nematocyst releases its tubule is one of the quickest processes in the animal kingdom. The force that propels the tubule probably comes from a buildup of osmotic (water) pressure. Each nematocyst can only fire once.</p>

<p>Once a cnidarian captures its prey, its tentacles maneuver the food into its mouth, located at the center of the ring of tentacles. The mouth leads into a digestive sac called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggastrov.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggastrov.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gastrovascular cavity</a>. As in other animals with a digestive sac, food enters through the mouth and is digested in the cavity. Undigested food and other wastes exit back through the mouth. Circulating fluids inside the cavity transport digested food to, and wastes from, the cells lining the cavity. This ability of the cavity to function as a circulatory (or vascular) system is the reason for "vascular" in gastrovascular (<i>gastro</i>- means "belly" or "gut"). Fluid in the cavity provides body support and helps give cnidarians their shape, much like water in a balloon.</p>

<p>Cnidarians have features that are absent in sponges but present in nearly all other animals. One such feature is the presence of a gastrula stage during embryonic development. Additionally, cnidarians have some basic tissues. For example, the outer layer of cells in hydras, called the epidermis, has protective and sensing functions. The sensing functions include a nerve net, a network of nerve cells that surround the hydra's body. The nerve net enables the hydra to respond to stimuli and coordinate its movements.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Cnidarians</span><br>
There are about 9,000 known species of cnidarians. These organisms have two kinds of body forms, both with radial symmetry. One body form is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolyp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolyp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">polyp</a>, a cylindrical body with tentacles radiating from one end. Animals with a polyp body form are mostly sessile organisms. Examples of polyp-shaped cnidarians include the hydras. The other type of cnidarian body form is the medusa, an umbrella-shaped form with fringes of tentacles around the lower edge. Jellies have the <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmedusa.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmedusa.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">medusa</a> body form. Medusas move freely about in the water, transported by wind, water currents, and rhythmic contractions of the "umbrella." Some cnidarian life cycles include both a medusa stage and a polyp stage. Others exist only as medusas. Still others such as hydras and sea anemones exist only as polyps.</p> 

<p>There are three classes of cnidarians. (Recall from Chapter 15 that <i>class</i> is a subgroup of <i>phylum</i>.) The class Hydrozoa includes the hydras, some coral animals, and the large Portuguese man-of-war (the tentacles are actually colonies of polyps). The class Scyphozoa includes the jellies. The class Anthozoa includes the sea anemones and most coral animals.</p>
