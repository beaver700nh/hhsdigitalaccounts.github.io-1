<p>Forty million years may seem like a long time. However, it is just a brief period in geologic time&#151;less than 1 percent of the total history of Earth. Yet, fossil evidence indicates that the diversity of animals increased dramatically during a 40-million-year period more than 500 million years ago.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Did Animal Life Begin?</span><br>
The origin of ingestion (eating) as a mode of nutrition was an important milestone in the beginning of animal life. Eating other organisms became a new way of "making a living" that made available previously untapped food resources. Diverse forms of animals evolved, differing partly in their feeding adaptations. Early animals populated the oceans, then fresh water, and eventually land.</p>

<p>The oldest known animal fossils come from Precambrian rocks that are about 700 million years old. (See Figure 15-18 to review the eras and periods of geologic time.) These fossils tell biologists little about the <i>origin</i> of the animal kingdom. They are the remains of animals with relatively complex body structures. This leads biologists to conclude that simpler animal forms probably existed prior to these complex animals. No fossils of such earlier animals have been found so far, so biologists mainly use comparisons of certain modern organisms to test hypotheses about animal origins.</p>

<p>As you have read, animals are multicellular organisms with specialized cells and, in most cases, specialized tissues and organs. How did this specialization arise? One hypothesis is that animals evolved from protists that lived as colonies of cells (Figure 23-23). Some of these colonies of identical cells may have, over time, formed hollow spherical colonies. Gradually, some of these cells may have become specialized for certain functions. As a result of this specialization, each cell was no longer independent. This is a key characteristic of multicellular organisms&#151;their cells are highly specialized and interdependent.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 23-23<br>This diagram illustrates one hypothesis about the gradual evolution of animals from a colonial protist.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Another fundamental feature of animals is multiple cell layers. One hypothesis proposes that one side of the hollow sphere folded inward, much like the development of a gastrula from a blastula embryo. Originally the "pocket" may have provided a primitive digestive cavity where cells eventually became specialized for feeding and digestion.</p>

<p>DNA analysis points to certain colonial protists as the modern organisms most closely related to animals. This evidence supports the hypothesis that both modern animals and modern colonial protists have a common ancestor. But what the earliest animals really looked like remains a mystery. The two main stages described above&#151;the hollow colony and the "infolded" stage&#151;are modeled after the blastula and gastrula stages in animal development. Indeed, these embryonic stages may resemble organisms that were early ancestors of animals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Cambrian "Explosion"</span><br>
Regardless of how they evolved, the great diversity of animals appears rather suddenly in the fossil record. There is fossil evidence of Precambrian sponges and cnidarians that lived about 550 million years ago. However, most of the major phyla of animals make their first fossil appearance during the first part of the Cambrian period, right after the Precambrian. This burst of animal diversity is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcambria.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcambria.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cambrian explosion</a>. It is marked by a rich collection of fossils that record the first animals with hard skeletons.</p>

<p>This relatively brief episode in the history of life probably lasted about 40 million years (between 565 and 525 million years ago). Fossil evidence indicates that during the late Precambian times, the seas contained various soft-bodied animals, which could have given rise to more complex forms. Still, the much greater diversity of Cambrian animals is striking compared to the relatively simple, less diverse soft-bodied animals of the late Precambian. Biologists are currently exploring various hypotheses to explain the Cambrian explosion, including genetic changes that made a greater diversity of body forms possible.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Hypothetical Phylogeny of Animals</span><br> 
Due to the relatively short period of time during which animals diversified, it is difficult from the fossil record to sort out the sequence of branching in the evolutionary history of animals. So how can biologists test hypotheses about evolutionary relationships among the animal phyla? As you read in Chapter 15, biologists use data from comparative anatomy, embryology, genetics, and molecular studies of living species to search for clues about common ancestry.
The phylogenetic tree in Figure 23-25 represents one hypothetical view of the evolutionary history of the animal kingdom. This tree is based mainly on an analysis of nucleotide sequences in certain genes (DNA) and RNA molecules. In addition to the invertebrates mentioned in this chapter, this tree also includes two phyla that you will study in Chapters 24 and 25&#151;the arthropods (such as insects, crabs, and spiders) and the chordates (vertebrates and closely related invertebrates).</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>At the bottom of the phylogenetic tree is the hypothetical colonial protist that may have given rise to the earliest animals. The tree has a series of branching points. The first branching splits the sponges, which lack true tissues, from all other animals, which do have tissues. Among the "tissue animals," the next branching divides the radial animals, such as cnidarians, from animals with bilateral symmetry. The bilateral animals are further split into protostomes and deuterostomes.</p>

<p>This tree tracing the evolutionary history of animals is based on the best available data from fossils, molecular analysis, comparative anatomy, and comparisons of embryonic development. Like other phylogenetic trees, this one serves as a hypothesis to stimulate further research and discussion. The hypothetical tree of animal origins will undoubtedly be revised to be compatible with new information as research continues.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Comparison of Body Systems of Invertebrates</span><br>
Figure 23-26 summarizes the body systems of some major phyla of invertebrates. Phyla are listed in the first column, starting with the sponges at the top left. Across the top of the table are the body systems. In some cases, especially in the relatively simple animals, the descriptions span several columns because the same tissues or organs accomplish several body functions. In other cases, the descriptions span several rows because there is no major difference in that body function from one phylum to the next. One of the phyla listed is the arthropods, about which you will read in the next chapter.</p>
