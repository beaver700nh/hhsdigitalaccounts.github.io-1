<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the diagram to answer the questions below. <br>
<b>a.</b> Describe what is happening in Step 1.<br>
<b>b.</b> Describe what is happening in Step 2.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="13images/13-cr-18.gif" width="260" height="315" alt="DNA process"></p>

<p><b>19. Analyzing Data</b> This gel shows results of DNA fingerprinting in a criminal case.<br>
<b>a.</b> Give a reason why the restriction enzyme treatment produced different lengths of fragments for the victim and each suspect.<br>
<b>b.</b> Does the DNA evidence indicate that either suspect was present at the scene of the crime? Explain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>20. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Distinguish between two different "cloning" techniques discussed in this chapter.</p>
  
<p><b>21. Problem Solving</b> A scientist has collected a genomic library using just one restriction enzyme. She fails to locate the desired gene using a nucleic acid probe. She tries a different restriction enzyme. Suggest why her first attempt might have failed and why her second might succeed.</p>

<p><b>22. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Compare and contrast the procedures for producing genetically modified plants and animals.</p>

<p><b>23. Making Generalizations</b> Your nerve cells and skin cells contain the same genes. Explain why these cells are different.</p>

<p><b>24. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> PCR is a technique by which living cells make many copies of a segment of DNA.<br>
<b>b.</b> Each of your cells expresses your genome.<br>
<b>c.</b> The <i>lac</i> operon is the gene that makes lactose in <i>E. coli.</i> </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> A scientist is attempting to clone a cow. The female cow into which the altered embryo is implanted eventually gives birth to two calves, indicating that the cow was already carrying an embryo when the altered one was implanted. Explain how you could detect which calf is the clone.</p>
