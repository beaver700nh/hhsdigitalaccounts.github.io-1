<p>Though each of your cells has the same set of genes, there are clearly many differences in how your cells look and function. This is because a different subset of genes is active in different cells. As with many other topics in genetics, biologists first began to understand gene regulation from their studies of bacteria.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulation of Genes in Prokaryotes</span><br>
Most bacteria are unicellular and do not have the ability to turn genes on or off to produce different kinds of cells as more complex organisms do. However, a bacterium can change its functions in response to changes in its environment. For example, consider the <i>E. coli</i> living in the constantly changing chemical environment of your intestine. Suppose you've just had a glass of milk. One of the main nutrients in milk is the sugar lactose. When lactose is plentiful in the intestine, <i>E. coli</i> makes the three enzymes necessary to absorb and use this disaccharide. When lactose is not plentiful, <i>E. coli</i> does not waste energy producing those enzymes.</p>

<p>The three genes coding for the enzymes that process lactose are next to each other in the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome (Figure 13-18). Before the genes, there are two short stretches of DNA called control sequences. Such a cluster of genes, along with its control sequences, is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/goperon.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/goperon.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">operon</a>. The operon discussed here is the <i>lac</i> operon, for "lactose." The first control sequence, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpromote.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpromote.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">promoter</a>, is the site where RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA. (Recall that RNA polymerase transcribes genes by making mRNA.) Between the promoter and the enzyme genes is a second control sequence called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/goperato.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/goperato.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">operator</a>. The operator acts like a switch, determining whether or not RNA polymerase can attach to the promoter.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-18.gif" width="450" height="108" ALT="Figure 13-18"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-18<br><i>E. coli</i> bacteria, natural inhabitants of your intestine, break down the sugar lactose. The genes that code for lactose-processing enzymes are located next to control sequences. Altogether, this stretch of DNA is called the <i>lac</i> operon. </span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>But what determines whether the operator switch is on or off? Transcription is turned off by a molecule called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grepress.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grepress.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">repressor</a>, a protein that functions by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter. In the absence of lactose, the repressor is active, and the lactose-processing genes are "turned off" (Figure 13-19, top). In contrast, when lactose molecules are present, they bind to the repressor protein and change its shape. In this new shape, the repressor cannot bind to the operator. RNA polymerase can now attach to the promoter and transcribe the DNA. The lactose-processing genes are "turned on" (Figure 13-19, bottom). When the bacterial cell uses up the available lactose, the repressor turns the genes off again by reattaching to the operator.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-19<br>The <i>lac</i> operon is inactive in the absence of lactose (top) because a repressor blocks attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter. With lactose present (bottom), the repressor is inactivated, and transcription of lactose-processing genes proceeds.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Scientists have discovered many operons in prokaryotes. Similar to the <i>lac</i> operon, these other operons enable the prokaryotes to tailor their cell chemistry to the changing environment. As a result, prokaryotes waste little energy providing enzymes for unnecessary reactions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulation of Genes in Eukaryotes</span><br>
Eukaryotic cells have more elaborate mechanisms than bacteria for regulating genes, but some of the general principles are the same. Eukaryotic DNA includes promoter sequences located before the point where transcription of certain genes begins.</p>

<p>Many types of proteins called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtranfac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtranfac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">transcription factors</a> regulate transcription by binding to those promoters or to RNA polymerases. These transcription factors are in turn activated and deactivated by certain chemical signals in the cell. For example, by attaching to transcription factors, some hormones signal cells in the body to express certain genes. <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneexp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggeneexp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Gene expression</a> is the transcription and translation of genes into proteins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">From Egg to Organism</span><br>
Gene expression is regulated in the cells of a eukaryotic organism starting when an egg is fertilized and begins to divide into a multicellular embryo. The position of each new cell in the embryo promotes expression of particular groups of genes. For example, genes associated with the head are expressed only in a particular region of "pre-head" cells in the embryo. Throughout development, a cell's position relative to its neighbors affects which genes it expresses. As the embryo continues to develop, individual cells undergo <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellula.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellula.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cellular differentiation</a>&#151;they become increasingly specialized in structure and function.</p>

<p>A particular cell only expresses genes that code for proteins with functions in that cell. For example, genes coding for enzymes required during glycolysis are active in all human cell types shown in the diagram in Figure 13-21. The gene for making insulin, though present in each type of cell, is only active (expressed&#151; transcribed and translated) in certain cells of the pancreas. Similarly, the gene coding for a transparent protein that coats the eye lens is only active in the developing eye of the embryo. The hemoglobin gene is inactive in all three cell types&#151;none of these cells produce hemoglobin.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-21.gif" width="450" height="256" ALT="Figure 13-21"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-21<br>Though all the genes of the genome are present in every type of cell, only a small, specific fraction of these genes are actually expressed in each type of cell. The yellow color indicates a gene that is "turned on" (expressed).</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Biologists can track the expression of thousands of genes at once using a "DNA chip." DNA chips can be used to track changes in gene activity in any cell during the course of development, or to diagnose genetic disorders by revealing abnormal expression of certain genes in different cell types.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Stem Cells</span><br>
During most organisms' development, certain groups of cells, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstemcel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstemcel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stem cells</a>, remain undifferentiated. Stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various types of cells. </p>

<p>A human embryo seven days after fertilization is a mostly hollow ball of about 100 cells, with embryonic stem cells in the center (Figure 13-22). After birth, clusters of stem cells remain in several organs. For example, your bone marrow contains stem cells that can develop into more than a dozen different types of blood cells throughout your life. In a bone marrow transplant, bone marrow from a healthy person is transplanted into a person with a bone marrow or blood disease such as leukemia. This enables the sick person to start making healthy blood cells again.</p>

						<p align="center"><table width="180" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-22.gif" width="180" height="193" ALT="Figure 13-22"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-22<br>Present at a very early stage of human development, stem cells have the potential to develop into any type of human cell.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>However, stem cell clusters present after birth cannot make the full range of new tissues with the ease that embryonic stem cells can. And there are some types of tissues, such as nervous tissue and heart muscle, for which stem cells may not exist in the adult individual. Embryonic stem cells may be able to help people with disabling diseases that affect such tissues, but some people question the ethics of this technology.</p>

<p>While the ethics of research on embryonic stem cells continues to be debated, new breakthroughs are being made with bone marrow stem cells. Recent laboratory experiments have shown that under the right conditions, bone marrow stem cells can sometimes develop into nerve cells. The procedure does not have a good success rate yet, but perhaps in the future, doctors will be able to "grow new parts" using a patient's very own stem cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Homeotic Genes</span><br>
Studying the effects of genetic mutations is another way to understand more about gene expression during development. For example, researchers have demonstrated that a particular gene functions as a master switch that triggers the development of eyes in <i>Drosophila.</i> A mutation that leads to expression of this gene in the wrong cells of the embryonic fly is like flipping on a switch in the wrong location. In the mutant flies, eyes develop on the antennae, legs, and wings, in addition to their normal location on the head. Some of the mutants grow as many as 14 eyes!</p>

<p>This gene is one of a class of <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghomeoti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghomeoti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">homeotic genes</a>, master control genes that direct development of body parts in specific locations in many organisms. In <i>Drosophila</i> each homeotic gene contains a 180-nucleotide sequence called a homeobox. A homeobox codes for a protein that promotes the transcription of genes involved in the development of specific body parts. This basic process of one gene product regulating the expression of other genes is common in the development of all multicellular organisms. In fact, the same or very similar homeobox sequence found in <i>Drosophila</i> also occurs in the homeotic genes of many other animals, including humans and other mammals (Figure 13-24). </p>

<p>The more scientists learn about the mechanisms of development in different organisms, the more underlying similarities they find. The similarities support the hypothesis that certain genes in diverse species were inherited from ancestors common to those species. In the next unit, you will explore how diverse organisms can evolve from a common ancestor.</p>
