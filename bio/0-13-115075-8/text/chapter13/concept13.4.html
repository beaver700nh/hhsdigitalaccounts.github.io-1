<p>Almost every week the news media announce a new advance in medicine, agriculture, law, or genetics. DNA technology is behind many of these advances&#151;it is rapidly changing the way society solves certain problems. You have already learned about some types of DNA technology. This section explores some additional techniques and their applications.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Mass-Producing DNA in a Test Tube</span><br>
The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolycha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolycha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</a> is a technique that makes many copies of a certain segment of DNA without using living cells. Starting with a single DNA molecule, PCR can generate 100 billion identical molecules in just a few hours (Figure 13-15). A great advantage of PCR is that it can copy one <i>specific segment</i> from within a tremendous length of DNA. The technique is so precise and powerful that its starting material does not even have to be purified DNA. </p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Only a tiny amount (less than 1 &#181;g, one millionth of a gram) of DNA needs to be present in the starting material. Using living cells instead would require a much longer time and a larger amount of the desired DNA.</p>

<p>Using PCR to produce multiple copies of a DNA sample can make further analysis of the sample much easier. It also enables scientists to make copies of very rare DNA. For example, scientists have used the technique to clone DNA pieces recovered from 5,000-year-old human remains, from a 40,000-year-old woolly mammoth frozen in a glacier, and from a 30-million-year-old plant fossil. PCR also has applications in medicine. For example, PCR makes it possible to detect viral genes in cells infected with the virus that causes AIDS.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Comparing DNA</span><br>
Often scientists want to compare DNA samples from different sources. One useful technique for sorting molecules or fragments of molecules by length is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggelelec.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggelelec.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gel electrophoresis</a>. Figure 13-16 shows this technique applied to DNA samples from four different individuals. First, each DNA sample is cut up into fragments by a group of restriction enzymes. Remember that restriction enzymes recognize and cut within specific DNA sequences. These specific sequences are located at different places along the DNA, depending on the source. Therefore, the assortment of fragments for each sample is unique. A few drops of each sample are placed in a small pocket, or well, at one end of a thin slab of gelatin-like material called a gel. The other end of the gel has a positive charge. All DNA molecules are negatively charged, so they move through pores in the gel toward the positive pole.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-16.gif" width="525" height="196" ALT="Figure 13-16"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-16<br>The gel electrophoresis technique shown above can be used to compare DNA of individuals or species.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>The shorter DNA fragments slip more easily through the pores of the gel. Therefore, after a set period of time, the shorter DNA fragments will travel farther through the gel and be closer to the positive end of the gel than the longer fragments. In the last step, the gel is treated with a stain that makes the DNA visible under ultraviolet light. The DNA fragments show up as a series of bands in each "lane" of the gel. Each band consists of many DNA fragments of one particular size. The pattern of bands will be different for each of the four samples because each sample has a unique set of DNA fragment lengths.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Genetic Markers</span> Cutting up an organism's entire genome with even just one kind of restriction enzyme produces thousands of differently sized DNA fragments. This in turn produces thousands of individual bands on a gel. With so many bands to look at, how does a biologist find any differences in the banding patterns between individual samples? The solution is to examine the banding pattern produced by specific portions of the genome called genetic markers. As illustrated in Concept 13.2, Figure 13-8, radioactively labeled DNA probes can "tag" the bands containing particular genetic markers.</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenemar.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenemar.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Genetic markers</a> are particular stretches of DNA that are variable among individuals. For example, DNA fragments that include certain disease alleles contain distinct genetic markers. Analyzing such markers can tell individuals with a family history for certain recessive diseases whether they are carriers of a disease allele.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">DNA Fingerprinting</span> Just as the skin patterns on your fingertips make up your particular set of fingerprints, you have a particular banding pattern produced by your restriction fragments called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdnafing.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdnafing.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">DNA fingerprint</a>. Unless you have an identical twin, no one else is likely to have the exact same DNA fingerprint as you. As you have just read, genetic markers can help to pick out the differences between two DNA fingerprints. Genetic markers can occur in alleles for diseases or other traits. Markers can also be located in one of the many noncoding stretches of the human genome (such as the introns you learned about in Chapter 11). These noncoding regions make up about 97 percent of the human genome. When DNA fingerprints are used in court as evidence, genetic markers from these highly variable noncoding regions are used. Why is this important? To use DNA to identify a specific person accurately, you want to compare genetic markers that are unlikely to be shared with any other person.</p>

<p>Using PCR and gel electrophoresis, a DNA fingerprint can be made from cells in a single drop of blood or from a hair follicle. DNA is extracted from the small sample, and multiple copies are made using PCR. Genetic markers are then compared. In most cases, the probability of two people having identical genetic markers is small&#151;somewhere between one chance in 100,000 and one chance in 1,000,000,000 (one billion), depending on the number of genetic markers compared.</p>
