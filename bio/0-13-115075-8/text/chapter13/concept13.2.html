<p>Bacteria are the "workhorses" of modern biotechnology. Biologists can use bacteria to mass-produce useful genes and proteins. These products can then be introduced into other organisms. To understand how this is possible, you first need to know more about how bacteria naturally transfer genes among themselves.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Engineering Bacteria: An Introduction</span><br>
Many bacteria contain plasmids. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasmid</a> is a small, circular DNA molecule separate from the much larger bacterial chromosome (Figure 13-3). Like a chromosome, a plasmid may carry a number of genes, and can make copies of itself. When a plasmid replicates, one copy can pass from one bacterial cell to another, resulting in gene "sharing" among bacteria. In some instances, gene transfer by plasmids can spread traits that help the bacterial cells survive. For example, some bacteria carry plasmids containing genes that make them resistant to antibiotics. The plasmids carrying these genes can be copied and spread throughout a bacterial population and can even be shared between bacterial species. As a result, an increasing variety of bacteria that cause human disease are becoming resistant to current antibiotics. </p>

						</table></p>

<p>While plasmids can spread antibiotic resistance, they can also be used for human benefit. Biologists use plasmids to move pieces of DNA, such as genes for useful products, into bacteria (Figure 13-4). To do this, a plasmid is removed from a bacterial cell, and the desired gene (from any kind of cell) is inserted into the plasmid. The plasmid is now a combination of its original DNA and the new DNA&#151;it is recombinant DNA. The recombinant plasmid is put back into a bacterial cell, where it can replicate many times as the cell reproduces, making many copies of a desired gene. This procedure is called <i>gene cloning</i>.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">"Cutting and Pasting" DNA</span><br>
You've just read that biologists can engineer a bacterium by inserting a specific gene into its plasmid. But how does a biologist remove a gene from one DNA molecule and put it into another? First, a piece of DNA containing the desired gene must be "cut" out of a much longer DNA molecule. The "tools" used to cut DNA are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grestric.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grestric.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">restriction enzymes</a>. In nature, these enzymes are found in bacteria and protect the bacteria against intruding DNA from other organisms and phages. The restriction enzymes work by chopping up the foreign DNA into small pieces. (The bacterium's DNA is chemically protected from being chopped up by its own restriction enzymes.) In the laboratory, restriction enzymes become a useful tool for moving DNA from one place to another. Each restriction enzyme recognizes particular short nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules, and cuts sugar-phosphate bonds in the DNA backbone at specific points within these sequences (Figure 13-5).</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="275" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-05.gif" width="275" height="476" ALT="Figure 13-5"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-5<br>Restriction enzymes cut DNA molecules at specific locations. Splicing together fragments of DNA from two different sources produces a recombinant DNA molecule.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Most restriction enzymes make staggered cuts (meaning not straight across the double-stranded DNA). These staggered cuts leave single-stranded DNA hanging off the ends of the fragments. The single-stranded portion of DNA is called a "sticky end" because it is available to bind to any sequence that is complementary to it. Sticky ends are useful for recombining DNA. The complementary sticky ends of two DNA fragments can join together by base-pairing with each other. Another enzyme, called DNA ligase, "pastes" the sticky ends together, thus repairing the DNA backbone.</p>


<p><span class="setextsub">Cloning Recombinant DNA</span><br>
Consider this example of a genetic engineering challenge. Suppose a molecular biologist has identified a human gene that codes for a valuable product called "protein <i>V</i>." By putting the gene in bacterial cells that can express the gene as protein, the biologist sets up a system for making large amounts of the protein. Making recombinant DNA in large enough amounts to be useful requires several steps. You can follow the process in Figure 13-6.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="475" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-06.gif" width="475" height="659" ALT="Figure 13-6"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-6<br>This diagram traces the cloning of the human gene for a hypothetical protein <i>V</i>.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Libraries of Cloned Genes</span> Step 5 of Figure 13-6 only depicts the production of the bacterial clone containing the desired gene. In reality, the procedure produces many different clones, each containing a different portion of the source DNA (human DNA, in this example). The procedure captures a large number of additional genes because the restriction enzyme makes cuts all over the source DNA. The result is that many genes are cloned in addition to the target gene.</p>

<p>The complete collection of cloned DNA fragments from an organism is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenomic.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenomic.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genomic library</a> (Figure 13-7). A typical plasmid contains a DNA fragment big enough to carry only one or a few genes. Together, the different recombinant plasmids in a genomic library contain the entire genome of the organism from which the DNA was derived&#151;in this case, a human.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="375" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-07.gif" width="375" height="177" ALT="Figure 13-7"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-7<br>A genomic library contains the complete collection of cloned DNA fragments from one organism.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Identifying Specific Genes With Probes</span> Once a genomic library is created for an organism, how does a biologist find a specific gene in that library? Just as you rely on a card catalog or computer system to help you find a particular book in a large library, biologists need tools to locate a specific gene among the possible thousands in a genomic library.</p>

<p>One method requires knowing at least part of the gene's nucleotide sequence. For example, suppose that the gene for protein <i>V</i> contains the base sequence TAGGCT. Knowing this, a biologist can use nucleotides labeled with a radioactive isotope to build a complementary single strand of DNA with the sequence ATCCGA (Figure 13-8). This complementary, radioactively labeled nucleic acid molecule is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleic.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleic.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nucleic acid probe</a>.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="340" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="13images/13-08.gif" width="340" height="260" ALT="Figure 13-8"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 13-8<br>Scientists use nucleic acid probes to locate specific genes. Besides labeling probes with radioactive isotopes, biologists can also use fluorescent (glow-in-the-dark) dyes to "tag" the probes.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
					
<p>Next the biologist treats the DNA being searched with chemicals or heat to separate the two DNA strands. The nucleic acid probe is mixed in with these single strands. The probe tags the correct DNA portion by pairing with the complementary sequence in the protein-<i>V</i> gene. Once the biologist uses this radioactive marker to identify the bacterial cells with the desired gene, those cells are allowed to multiply further, producing the desired gene in large amounts.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Useful Products From Genetically Engineered Microorganisms</span><br>
The news is full of examples of recombinant DNA technology in action. Some kinds of bacteria engineered with recombinant DNA can break down certain chemicals and help to clean up toxic waste sites. Other engineered bacteria are mass-producing useful chemicals, from pesticides to therapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>The genetic engineering of bacteria has many useful applications in medicine. Consider insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Before 1982, the main sources of insulin were pig and cattle tissues. Insulin obtained from these animals is chemically similar, but not identical, to human insulin. As a result, some people using those sources of insulin experienced negative side effects. Now some types of diabetes can be treated without the side effects by using pure human insulin produced by recombinant DNA technology.</p>

<p>Recombinant DNA technology is also helping to develop effective vaccines against disease-causing microbes. A vaccine exposes a person's immune system to disabled microbes (or parts of microbes). This enables the immune system to recognize and quickly defend the body against any later exposures to actual disease-causing agents. For example, genes for proteins of the virus that causes hepatitis B have been cloned in yeast cells, allowing mass-production of viral proteins. These viral proteins are then used to make a vaccine against this serious and sometimes fatal liver disease.</p>

<p>In Concept 13.3, you will learn about ways in which scientists use recombinant DNA technology to produce genetically modified multicellular organisms.</p>
