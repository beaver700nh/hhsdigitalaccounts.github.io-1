<p>If you've ever grown a plant from a cutting, you know that some new plants can be easy to grow without actually planting seeds. For many species, a new plant can be grown in the laboratory from just one adult plant cell. Taking advantage of this fact, biologists can produce a genetically engineered plant cell that grows into an entire plant with new traits.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Producing Genetically Modified Plants</span><br>
Using recombinant DNA technology, scientists are able to improve various characteristics of certain crop plants. For example, scientists have inserted genes for delayed ripening, improved nutritional content, and resistance to spoilage or disease. Such crops are said to be genetically modified. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenemod.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenemod.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genetically modified organism (GMO)</a> is any organism that has acquired one or more genes by artificial means. A GMO is said to be <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtransge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtransge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">transgenic</a> if the source of the new genetic material is a different species.</p>

<p>Genetic engineering is replacing traditional methods of plant breeding in many situations. It is used most often when a plant's useful traits are determined by one or only a few genes. In the year 2000, about half the crops of soybeans and corn grown in the United States were genetically modified in some way. For example, many crops received genes for herbicide resistance. Herbicides applied to fields of these plants destroy the weeds but do not harm the crop. Other genetically modified plants are being engineered to resist pest insects and fungi.</p>

<p>Biologists often use a plasmid from the soil bacterium <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> to introduce new genes into plant cells. Figure 13-11 outlines the procedure for producing a genetically modified (GM) plant. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Producing Genetically Modified Animals</span><br>
Biologists routinely use DNA technology to make vaccines and growth hormones for treating farm animals. However, only recently have researchers tested ways to genetically modify the animals. Genetically modifying animals is more difficult than producing GM plants. In mammals, the procedure requires extracting an egg cell from a female. Sperm from the same species is used to fertilize the egg in a "test-tube" environment. Then the desired gene is injected into the fertilized egg, and the egg is returned to a uterus (womb) where it can develop into an embryo. It usually takes many attempts before an egg actually incorporates the DNA. If the embryo develops successfully, the result is a GM animal. The offspring contains a gene or genes from a third "parent" that may even be of another species.</p>

<p>The goals of genetically modifying an animal are often the same as the goals of traditional breeding. For instance, researchers try to make a sheep with better-quality wool, a pig with leaner meat, or a fish that will mature in a shorter time. In other cases the goal is to make a transgenic animal that produces a large amount of an otherwise rare biological substance for medical use. Most cases involve adding a gene for a desired human protein, such as a hormone, to the genome of a farm mammal. The gene is added in such a way that the desired human protein is secreted in the animal's milk. The human protein can then be purified. This is a good method for cloning certain genes that are not expressed well in bacterial clones (meaning that when the same genes are placed in bacteria, the protein products are not made well, or at all).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Animal Cloning</span><br>
You have so far learned how individual genes can be cloned in bacteria, plants, or animals. Entire genomes can be cloned, too. For centuries plants have been cloned from cuttings, as you will learn in Chapter 20. In recent years, scientists have figured out how to clone animals&#151;first the famous sheep named "Dolly," and more recently, cats and pigs.</p>

<p>In cloning an entire animal, the nucleus from a single cell of that adult animal replaces the nucleus of an unfertilized egg cell from another animal of the same species. The procedure is much the same as that described above for producing a GM animal, except that instead of inserting a gene into the egg cell, an entire foreign nucleus (and all its genes) replaces the egg's own nucleus. The egg then develops into an animal that has the same genome as the nuclear donor. The new animal is a clone of the animal that supplied the nucleus.</p>

<p>Cloning offers the potential to mass-produce an animal with a desirable set of traits. This is much faster than using traditional animal breeding to select for a certain set of traits over several generations of animals. One particularly useful application is cloning a GM animal. This could prove easier than starting from scratch to produce each new animal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The GMO Controversy</span><br>
You may have heard news stories questioning the safety of crops carrying artificially inserted genes. Could they be harmful to human health or to the environment? For example, could GM crops pass their new genes to closely related plants in nearby wild areas? Pollen from crop plants carrying genes for resistance to herbicides might fertilize the flowers of related wild plants. The offspring might then become "superweeds" that would be very difficult to control. The National Academy of Sciences released a study in 2000 finding no evidence that crops genetically modified to resist pests pose significant health or environmental risks. However, the authors of the study recommended stricter regulations on how GM crops are used and suggested further research.</p>

<p>Another concern is that GM plants or animals could have unknown risks to human consumers. Some consumers think labeling that clearly identifies GM products should be required. Transgenic farm animals used to make medicines may also pose certain risks. For example, human proteins produced in the milk of an engineered animal might differ slightly from natural human proteins. For this reason the proteins have to be tested very carefully. It is important to make sure that the proteins in medicines or foods produced by GMOs will not cause allergic reactions or other negative effects in individuals receiving them.</p>

<p>Governments and regulatory agencies throughout the world are dealing with issues of how to ensure that new biotechnology products and procedures are safe. In the United States, several government agencies evaluate all genetic engineering projects for risks.</p>
