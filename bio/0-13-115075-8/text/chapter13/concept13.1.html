<p>For thousands of years humans have relied on other organisms to do certain jobs. People used yeast to make bread long before they understood the chemistry of fermentation. And farmers bred animals and plants to produce offspring with desired traits without knowing about the activities of DNA and chromosomes. Now, as researchers learn more about biology at the molecular level, they are developing astonishing new ways to modify organisms in the laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Beginnings of DNA Technology</span><br>
The use of organisms to perform practical tasks for humans is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiotech.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiotech.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biotechnology</a>. On the forefront of biotechnology today are applications that analyze and manipulate the genomes of organisms at the molecular level. This branch of biotechnology is called DNA technology.</p>

<p>During the last 35 years, many of the developments in DNA technology came from research with the common bacterium <i>Escherichia coli. E. coli</i> and other bacterial species have been very useful models for gene manipulations. In Chapter 9, you read how sexual reproduction can lead to new combinations of genetic information in offspring. Unlike plants and animals, bacteria do not undergo meiosis, produce gametes, or reproduce by fertilization. Yet, they have their own means of genetic recombination, which you will read about in more detail in Chapter 16. Scientists have been able to apply these natural processes to transfer DNA into bacteria.</p>

<p>Through their experiments in the 1940s, American scientists Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum demonstrated that two bacteria can form a tunnel-like connection. One bacterium can pass genes to the other through the connection. Since Lederberg and Tatum's discovery, researchers have identified two other ways that bacteria acquire new combinations of genes. Viruses can carry bacterial genes from one bacterial cell to another, and bacteria also can take up loose pieces of DNA from their surrounding environment. In fact, this last method was the cause of the "transformation" of the harmless strain of bacteria in Griffith's experiment, discussed in Chapter 11. In all three processes, a bacterial cell can incorporate new DNA into its genome.
</p>

<p>Using this knowledge about the different ways that DNA can be transferred and recombined, scientists have developed a set of laboratory techniques called recombinant DNA technology. <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grecombi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grecombi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Recombinant DNA technology</a> combines genes from different sources&#151;even different species&#151;into a single DNA molecule. You will learn about the basic techniques of recombinant DNA technology in Concept 13.2.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">DNA Technology and Frontiers of Research in Biology</span><br>
In Chapter 12 you read about the ongoing work of the Human Genome Project. In addition, biologists are also sequencing the genomes of many other important research organisms. Some organisms whose genomes have already been sequenced include the fruit fly, baker's yeast, the bacterium <i>E. coli,</i> and the rice plant. </p>


<p>Knowledge about genomes can lead to useful applications. For example, sequencing the genome of rice could lead to ways of making it a more nutritious food source. The many similarities among the genomes of different kinds of organisms also means that research on simpler organisms can sometimes be applied to human biology. For example, researchers can sometimes learn how a human gene works by studying its counterpart in another organism, such as yeast.</p>

<p>In addition to the many applications in fields such as medicine and agriculture, analyzing and manipulating genomes can help answer one of biology's most important questions: "How does a complex multicellular organism develop from a single cell?" Concept 13.5 will explore this topic further. Throughout this chapter, in addition to learning about the techniques of DNA technology, you will explore some of the benefits and risks of this growing field of study.</p>
