<p>Have you ever observed how a plant on a windowsill grows toward the sunlight? Its growth may become so uneven that the plant may topple over. What causes the plant to grow in this lopsided manner?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Discovery of a Plant Hormone</span><br>
Earlier in this book you read about Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. But Darwin also studied other topics in biology. In the late 1800s, Charles Darwin and his son Francis conducted some of the first experiments to answer the question of how plants grow toward light. The Darwins observed that grass seedlings would bend toward light while they were growing. But when they cut off the tips of the seedlings, the shoots grew straight up, without bending (Figure 22-2). Next, the Darwins placed dark caps on the tips of the seedlings, shielding out light. Again, the seedlings grew straight up rather than bending toward the light source. However, when the Darwins placed clear caps over the tips of the seedlings or shielded only the lower part of the seedlings, they observed the normal bending response to light.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 22-2<br>The Darwins conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine the region of a seedling responsible for detecting light.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The results of these experiments suggested that something in the tip of a shoot is responsible for sensing light. However, the response, the bending of the shoot, occurs below the tip. The Darwins hypothesized that a shoot tip detects light and transmits a signal down to the growing region of the shoot.</p>

<p>Other scientists later confirmed that the signal is a chemical messenger produced in the shoot tip. They also discovered several other types of chemical messengers. These chemical messengers in plants are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplantho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplantho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plant hormones</a>.</p>

<p>Plant hormones control many key functions in a plant's life. For example, hormones control a plant's germination from a seed, growth, flowering, and fruit production. Like animals, plants produce hormones in very small amounts, but even tiny amounts can have large effects. Just a few molecules of hormone can cause a cell to respond by turning genes on or off, by inhibiting enzymes, or by changing the properties of plasma membranes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Functions of the Five Major Hormones</span><br>
Plant biologists have identified several major types of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene. No single hormone acts alone. Instead a balance of the various hormones controls the life of a plant.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Auxins</span> The plant hormone whose effects the Darwins observed was later identified as one of a class of hormones called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gauxin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gauxin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">auxins</a>. The chief function of the auxins is to promote plant growth. The name is from the Greek <i>auxein</i>, meaning "to increase." </p>

<p>Auxins are produced in the apical meristems at the tips of shoots. They promote cell elongation (lengthening). When a grass seedling is exposed to light from one direction, auxin builds up on the shaded side and stimulates growth beneath the tip. Because the cells on the shaded side are exposed to more auxin, they elongate (lengthen) more than the cells on the lighted side (Figure 22-3). The uneven growth rate on the two sides of the plant causes the shoot to bend toward the light.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="22images/22-03.gif" width="250" height="269" ALT="Figure 22-3"></td>

						</table></p>

<p>How do auxins make cells elongate? One hypothesis is that they trigger mechanisms that loosen the bonds holding the components of the cell walls together. With its cell wall less rigid, the cell, which is hypertonic to its surroundings, is free to take up more water by osmosis. The cell elongates. Auxins also have other effects in a plant. For example, they can stimulate secondary growth of a plant stem by promoting cell division in the vascular cambium.</p>

<p>Seeds secrete auxins that stimulate the development of the surrounding ovary into fruit. Exposing some kinds of plants to auxins can cause fruit development without any need for pollination and seed development. Farmers use this technology to produce seedless tomatoes, cucumbers, and other fruits by spraying the flowering plants with auxins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Cytokinins</span> Plant hormones called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcytokin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcytokin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cytokinins</a> (sy toh KY ninz) stimulate cell division. These hormones are produced in actively growing tissues, particularly in embryos, roots, and fruits. Cytokinins made in the roots reach target cells in stems by moving upward in xylem sap. One effect of cytokinins is to slow the aging of flowers and fruits.</p>

<p>The effects of cytokinins are often affected by the concentration of auxins present. For example, cytokinins entering the shoot system from the roots promote cell division in axillary buds. This encourages branching of the plant. But auxin traveling down the plant from the terminal bud inhibits branching. The result is fewer and shorter branches near the tip of the plant, where auxin levels are higher than cytokinin levels. To produce a bushier plant, gardeners often "pinch back" the terminal buds. This reduces auxin levels compared to cytokinin levels, causing the plant to branch more.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Gibberellins</span> Produced at the tips of both stems and roots, <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggibbere.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggibbere.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gibberellins</a> (jib uhr EL inz) cause a wide variety of effects. One of their main roles is to stimulate growth of stems by promoting both cell division and cell elongation. This effect is similar to the effect of auxins. However, researchers do not yet fully understand how the actions of these two classes of hormones are related. Also in combination with auxins, gibberellins can influence fruit development. One use of gibberellins is in growing the Thompson variety of seedless grapes. Applying gibberellins makes the grapes grow larger, and the clusters grow so that there is more space between the individual grapes.</p>

<p>Gibberellins are also important in promoting seed germination in some species. For example, with exposure to water, the embryos in some cereal grains, such as barley, release gibberellins that stimulate the breakdown of stored nutrients in the endosperm, making them available to the embryo.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Abscisic Acid</span> Under certain conditions, such as at the onset of winter or during a severe drought, a plant is more likely to survive if it becomes dormant. During <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdormanc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdormanc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dormancy</a>, the plant stops growing. At such times, the hormone <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gabscisi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gabscisi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">abscisic acid</a> (ab SIS ik), abbreviated ABA, inhibits cell division in buds and in the vascular cambium. In other words, ABA halts primary and secondary growth. ABA also promotes dormancy in seeds&#151;the opposite effect of gibberellins. Some seeds remain dormant until a downpour washes ABA out of the seeds. (Gibberellins do not wash out as easily.) Without the inhibitory effect of ABA, the stimulatory effect of gibberellins signals the seeds to germinate.</p>

<p>ABA also acts as a "stress hormone" in growing plants. For instance, when a plant is dehydrated, ABA builds up in leaves and causes stomata to close. As you learned in Chapter 21, closing stomata reduces transpiration and prevents further water loss from plants. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ethylene</span> In the early 1900s, oranges and grapefruits were ripened for market in sheds. Farmers would heat the sheds with kerosene stoves, believing that the heat ripened the fruit. Plant biologists later learned that the ripening was actually due to ethylene, a gas released when kerosene is burned. <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gethylen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gethylen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Ethylene</a> is also a naturally occurring plant hormone that stimulates fruit ripening.</p>


<p>Another effect of ethylene is to promote "leaf drop," the loss of leaves from deciduous trees every autumn. Leaf drop is caused by a shift in the amounts of ethylene and auxin in leaf petioles. Ethylene concentration increases and auxin concentration decreases in response to autumn's shorter days and cooler temperatures. Leaf drop is an adaptation that helps keep trees from drying out in winter. Because their roots cannot take up water from the frozen ground during winter, trees cannot afford to lose water by evaporation from leaves.</p>
