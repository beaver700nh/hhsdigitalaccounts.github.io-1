<p>In addition to responding quickly to touch, every day at dusk the sensitive plant <i>Mimosa</i> folds its leaves. Every day at dawn, it unfolds its leaves. These movements, seen in many other plants as well, form a regular daily pattern.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Circadian Rhythms</span><br>
Perhaps you've experienced jet lag when you've traveled rapidly to a new time zone. This is because your body is still operating on the clock from your old time zone. For example, with jet lag you feel tired when it's time for bed at home, say 10 P.M., even though it's only 7 P.M. at your destination.</p>

<p>Your pulse rate, blood pressure, and body temperature change with the time of day. A plant's functions change throughout a 24-hour period, too. A biological cycle that occurs about every 24 hours is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcircadi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcircadi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">circadian rhythm</a> (sur KAY dee un). An organism's "biological clock" is set by daily signals from the environment, especially light. In experiments where organisms are kept in constant darkness, the circadian rhythms continue, but the cycle lengths become either shorter or longer than 24 hours. The changing of night and day is required to set the clock exactly to a 24-hour cycle. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Day Length and Seasons</span><br>
In addition to maintaining a 24-hour cycle, plants also respond to changes in environmental cues that come with the seasons. For example, most plants produce flowers, germinate seeds, and become dormant at specific times during the year. Some plants flower in the spring, for instance, while others flower in the fall. Some species flower on exactly the same day every year!</p>

<p>Plants use the relative lengths of day and night to detect the time of year. The ability to use this environmental stimulus to time seasonal activities is known as <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphotope.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphotope.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">photoperiodism</a>. Certain plants, such as chrysanthemums and poinsettias, flower in fall or winter when the dark period exceeds a certain length, called <i>critical night length</i> (Figure 22-15). They are examples of <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gshortda.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gshortda.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">short-day plants</a> (long-night plants). In contrast, <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glongday.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glongday.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">long-day plants</a> (short-night plants), such as spinach, lettuce, and irises, usually flower in late spring or early summer when dark periods shorten. Spinach, for example, flowers only when night length is less than 10 hours. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdayneut.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdayneut.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">day-neutral plant</a> flowers when it reaches a certain stage of maturity, regardless of day length at that time. Dandelions, tomatoes, and rice are day-neutral.</p>

Short-day (long-night) plants such as the chrysanthemum bloom when night lasts <i>longer</i> than a critical length. If that critical night length is interrupted with a flash of light, the plant fails to bloom. b. In contrast, long-day (short-night) plants, such as the iris, bloom when nights are <i>shorter</i> than a critical length.

<p>Flower growers use information about photoperiodism to produce certain flowers out of season. Chrysanthemums, for instance, are short-day plants that normally bloom in autumn. But a florist can prevent a chrysanthemum from blooming until the spring by exposing the plants to flashes of light during the long autumn and winter nights. The plant thus detects two short nights, instead of one long night, and fails to bloom.</p>

<p>How does a plant monitor day length as the seasons change? Sunrise and sunset are detected by pigmented proteins called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphytoch.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphytoch.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phytochromes</a> (FYT uh krohm). When phytochromes absorb the red light that is abundant at sunrise, they change shape to an active form that triggers a variety of plant responses. After sunset, the phytochromes gradually change back to their inactive form. These sunrise/sunset cues combine with the biological clock to indicate the proportions of day and night in a 24-hour period. This is another example of how control systems keep a plant in tune with its external world.</p>
