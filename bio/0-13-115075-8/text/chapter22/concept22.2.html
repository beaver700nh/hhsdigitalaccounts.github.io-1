<p>A vine grows round and round the trunk of a tree. A seed in the dark ground begins to grow toward the surface. Although plants lack a nervous system, they do sense and respond to signals from their environment.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Rapid Plant Movements</span><br>
All plants are sensitive to their surroundings. They respond to such stimuli as light, temperature, gravity, and touch. Most plant responses are slow&#151;so slow that you can't see the response occurring. In a few plant species, however, the response is very rapid indeed.</p>

<p>The leaves of the tropical plant <i>Mimosa pudica</i> quickly fold up when touched, giving the plant a wilted appearance. After time, the leaves return to their normal position. This response is an example of a rapid plant movement. Touch triggers responses that cause cells at the base of each leaflet to lose ions. Due to osmosis, water follows the ions out of the cells. The cells shrink, causing the leaflet to droop.</p>

<p>What is the function of this leaf-folding behavior? Some scientists hypothesize that leaf folding in a heavy wind is an adaptation that reduces surface area and saves water. Another hypothesis states that the folding response makes the plant less attractive to animals trying to eat the plant. The rapid movement may serve to bump off (or scare off) an insect, for example.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Tropisms</span><br>
<a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtropism.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtropism.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Tropisms</a> are growth responses that cause parts of a plant to grow slowly toward or away from a stimulus. Tropisms are typically regulated by plant hormones, especially auxins. Unlike rapid plant movements, tropisms are not rapidly reversible.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Responses to Touch</span> A change in plant growth due to touch is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthigmot.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthigmot.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">thigmotropism</a>. Most climbing plants have tendrils that respond by coiling and grasping when they touch rigid objects. Thigmotropism enables climbing plants to use objects for support while growing toward sunlight.</p>

<p>Another example of thigmotropism is a seedling's response to mechanical stress. For example, a growing seedling may press against a rock in the soil. It is advantageous for the seedling to bend, avoiding the obstacle, instead of damaging itself by growing straight into it and failing to reach the soil surface. Researchers have shown that ethylene plays a role in this response.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Responses to Light</span> The growth of a plant part toward or away from light is an example of <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphototr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphototr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phototropism</a>. You have already learned how auxins regulate this response in grass seedlings. Shining light on one side of a shoot tip causes an uneven distribution of auxins, with more on the shaded side than on the lighted side. The shoot tips contain a protein with an attached light-absorbing molecule. When activated by light, this protein signals molecules that affect auxin transport down from the shoot tip.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Responses to Gravity</span> A plant's growth response to gravity is called gravitropism. One example of gravitropism is seen in germinating seeds. A seedling's shoot grows upward and its root downward into the soil, no matter how the seed landed or was planted in the soil. Roots and shoots of mature plants respond to gravity as well.</p>

<p>How do plants "know" up from down? Is a plant hormone involved? Because gravitropism has opposite effects in shoots and roots, different explanations (and hormones) may be responsible. Plant biologists have yet to answer this question. One hypothesis is that gravity pulls organelles containing dense starch grains to the low points of cells. The uneven distribution of these organelles may in turn signal the cells to move auxins within the root or shoot, thus affecting the cell's direction of growth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Coping With Stressful Environments</span><br>
Plants are often exposed to stressful environmental conditions. Changes in levels of water, salt, and temperature can affect a plant's growth, as well as its ability to reproduce and even to survive. Drought, flooding, or salty soil can devastate natural plant populations as well as agricultural crops. But many plants are adapted to withstand temporary stress. And some plants are especially adapted to live where conditions are always too stressful for other plants.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Drought</span> A drought is a prolonged period of inadequate rainfall. When plants adapted to more moderate climates are exposed to drought, they can become stressed and weakened. In a drought, a plant may lose more water through transpiration than it takes up from the soil. This shortage of water inhibits the growth of young leaves, causes existing leaves to wilt, and reduces photosynthesis. Plants respond to drought by conserving water. As you learned in Chapter 21, one way plants conserve water is by closing their stomata, thereby slowing down the rate of transpiration. You read earlier in this chapter that the hormone ABA initiates this response.</p>

<p>Some plants have adaptations that enable them to withstand a very dry climate. Cacti and similar plants (called succulents) store water in their fleshy stems and thrive in the desert. The stems of succulents have a thick cuticle. These plants often have modified leaves (spines) instead of broad flat leaves that would lose a lot of water to evaporation. The green, fleshy stems are the main photosynthetic organs.</p>

<p>Plants adapted to cold, dry arctic regions tend to have very small leaves and grow very low to the ground. These adaptations help reduce transpiration during the short growing season by minimizing exposure to the harsh, dry winds that blow over the landscape.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Flooding</span> Did you know that an overwatered houseplant can suffocate? Waterlogged soil lacks the air spaces that provide oxygen for cellular respiration in the roots. In addition, oxygen moves more slowly through water than through air. Yet, some plants are adapted to live in very wet habitats. Mangrove trees, for example, grow in coastal marshes but have roots that are partly above ground. These aboveground roots provide oxygen for the underwater parts of roots.</p>

<p>How do plants that are less specialized for aquatic environments respond to unusually wet conditions, such as temporarily waterlogged soil? Plant cells that are deprived of oxygen release the hormone ethylene. The ethylene causes some of the cells in the submerged roots to die. Killing these cells creates air tubes that function as "snorkels." These air tubes carry oxygen to the submerged roots.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Salt Stress</span> Too much salt can also threaten the health of plants. When excess salt builds up in the soil, root cells lose water to the soil through osmosis.</p>

<p>Most plants cannot survive salt stress for long. The exceptions are the <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghalophy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghalophy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">halophytes</a> (HAL oh fyts), salt-tolerant plants with adaptations such as salt glands. These glands pump salt out of the plant across the leaf epidermis, and rain washes the salt away. There are other adaptations, too. One salt marsh plant called pickleweed pumps excess salt to stems at the tips of the plant. Then the pickleweed sheds these stems, getting rid of the salt.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Defending Against Disease</span><br> 
Plants do not live in isolation in their communities. They interact with many other species. As you read in Chapter 21, some of these interactions, such as mycorrhizae and root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, benefit both species. But many of the interactions are not beneficial to the plant. Plants are subject to infection by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Each of these pathogens may damage tissues or even kill the plant.</p>

<p>Plants have adaptations that defend against infection. A plant's first line of defense against infection is the physical barrier of the plant's "skin," its epidermis. However, pathogens  can cross this barrier through wounds or openings in the plant, such as the stomata. Once infected, the plant uses chemicals as a second line of defense. Some of the chemicals are antimicrobial. For example, some chemical defenses attack molecules in the cell wall of a bacterium. Other chemicals signal lignin production. This hardens the cell walls around the infected area and seals off the invading pathogen from the rest of the plant.</p>

<p>A plant also inherits the ability to recognize and attack certain pathogens. In fact, plant breeders often select for this ability of plants to resist specific diseases. And one goal of making transgenic plants is to introduce disease-resistance genes from different plant species into crop plants (see Chapter 13).</p>

<p>In addition to defending against disease, many plants defend themselves against being eaten. They may have physical defenses such as thorns or chemical defenses such as poisons.</p>
