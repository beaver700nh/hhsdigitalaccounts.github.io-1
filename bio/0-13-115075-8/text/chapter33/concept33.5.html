<p>Infants are born with several basic reflexes. For example, an infant will suck on anything put into its mouth, and will tightly close its fingers around an object placed into its palm. Beyond these basic reflexes, all other growth and behavior from infancy through adulthood are the result of ongoing developmental events. Each stage of life&#151;childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age&#151;has its own biological milestones.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Infancy Through Adolescence</span><br>
Though it may seem never-ending at the time, the infant, childhood, and adolescent years are only a small part of the average human's life. During that time, however, tremendous changes are taking place.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Infancy</span> The first year of a baby's life is filled with rapid physical growth and major developmental gains. A newborn's muscular and nervous systems are poorly developed. However, a baby is born with vital basic reflexes. The sucking reflex enables a baby to respond to the touch of a nipple and receive nourishment. Another basic reflex that babies have is the ability to cry, signaling that they are hungry, tired, wet, or in pain.</p>

<p>Although a baby comes into the world still dependent on an adult's care, within a year or so the baby will be well on the way to eating solid foods, communicating, and walking.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Childhood</span> From 12 months until around 12 or 13 years is the period called childhood. Most children absorb new information and skills quickly and learn to communicate effectively through speaking and writing. Children learn how to interact socially and emotionally with people inside and outside of their families.</p>

<p>Most physical changes during childhood are more gradual than those that occur during infancy. With each year, height increases and muscles are toned. There is also a gradual change in body proportions. A young child's head, for example, is large compared to the rest of its body. But during childhood the body and limbs grow at a faster rate than the head, resulting in more adult-looking proportions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Adolescence</span> During adolescence, the years from the beginning of puberty through 18 or 20, humans undergo significant physical and emotional development. <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpuberty.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpuberty.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Puberty</a> is the period when the reproductive organs first become functional. As adolescence progresses, the reproductive organs mature, and sex hormone secretions reach their adult levels. Females begin to ovulate and menstruate. Males start to produce sperm.</p>

<p>In response to sex hormones, female secondary sex characteristics develop, such as breasts and pubic hair. Males develop secondary sex characteristics such as broader shoulders, larger muscles, deeper voice, and pubic and facial hair. Emotionally, adolescence is a period when both females and males become more aware of themselves as independent humans and learn how they fit into the world.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Adulthood and Aging</span><br>
After adolescence, the human body stops growing in height, and organ systems have matured. During the next couple of decades, many people focus on careers and family lives, seeking out mates and having children. However, the body changes with age. Women cannot become pregnant after they stop ovulating, usually in their 50s. <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmenopau.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmenopau.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Menopause</a> is the time in life when a woman stops ovulating. Hormonal changes at menopause can cause physical symptoms. For example, low estrogen levels can cause decreased bone density. As men age, they produce decreasing levels of testosterone, but they continue to produce sperm well into old age.</p>

<p>As people age, they often experience more health problems. For example, decreased flexibility and memory loss can be sources of frustration for the elderly. A lifelong commitment to a healthy lifestyle can help minimize some of the negative aspects of aging.</p>
