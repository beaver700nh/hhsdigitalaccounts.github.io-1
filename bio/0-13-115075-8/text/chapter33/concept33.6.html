<p>As with other organ systems, there are steps you can take throughout life to maintain the good health of your reproductive system. It is especially important to be aware of and prevent diseases that can affect your ability to have children in the future, or diseases that can even be fatal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Wellness Approach to Reproductive Health</span><br>
Discussing personal health issues related to reproductive systems can seem awkward and embarrassing, especially for adolescents.  However, maintaining a healthy reproductive system is important to a person's overall health and critical to one's ability to have children when that time comes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Gynecology</span> The medical specialty that focuses on the wellness of female reproductive organs is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggynecol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggynecol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gynecology</a>. Many females, as early as adolescence, have annual gynecological exams to monitor the health of reproductive organs. These exams usually include examination of the breasts for abnormalities. A typical exam would also include Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to screen for cervical cancer. The test consists of gently scraping the cervix with a plastic spatula to collect a sample of tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory.</p>

<p>Many gynecologists are also obstetricians, resulting in the abbreviation for both specialties, OB/GYN. The obstetrician focuses on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and childbirth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Urology</span> The medical specialty that focuses on the wellness of the urinary tract and bladder for females and males is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gurology.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gurology.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">urology</a>. Males also see urologists for problems of the reproductive organs (penis, scrotum, testes, and prostate gland). After the age of 40, many men have an annual blood test to screen for prostate cancer. A higher than normal level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in a patient's blood may help doctors discover prostate cancer at an early stage. Early detection improves the chance of successful treatment with minimal or short-term effects.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</span><br>
Sexual contact introduces the possibility of spreading infectious diseases, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsexuall.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsexuall.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)</a>. There are two main groups of STDs: bacterial and viral. Figure 33-21 lists some common STDs and their symptoms. Bacterial STDs can usually be cured with antibiotics, especially if treated early. For most viral STDs there is no cure. Some, like HIV, have fatal consequences.</p>

<p>Maintaining the health of your reproductive system is required in order to have children. But it is also essential for a healthy adulthood and even, in the case of some diseases, your survival. It is important to bring unusual symptoms to the attention of your doctor as early as possible for a better chance of treating any disease.</p>
