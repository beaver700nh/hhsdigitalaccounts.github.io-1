<p>Molecular and fossil evidence has convinced many biologists that birds are reptiles. This evidence indicates that dinosaurs, crocodilians, and birds are more closely related to each other than any one of them is to turtles and lizards. Other biologists, however, prefer the traditional taxonomy that places birds in a separate class (class Aves).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Birds</span><br>
Birds are endothermic amniotes with specialized adaptations for flight. These adaptations include a specialized wing shape that produces lift for flight; feathers, which function in both flight and endothermy; and numerous weight-reducing features.</p>

<p>Bird wings are shaped like airfoils (like airplane wings). The top surface of the wing is curved in a way that creates lift as air moves past the wing (Figure 26-8). The shape and arrangement of the feathers form the wing into an airfoil. <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfeather.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfeather.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Feathers</a> are modified scales that are made of keratin. Feathers may have first evolved as an adaptation that insulated the animal and helped  conserve heat. In modern birds, feathers still provide insulation and contribute to birds being endotherms.</p>

<p>Birds have a system of branching air sacs that function with their lungs in respiration. The air-sac system helps supply the high levels of oxygen that support a high rate of metabolism. This provides the energy necessary for the hard-working flight muscles. This high metabolic activity also provides heat that contributes to endothermy. Another advantage of the air-sac system is a reduction of the overall density of the bird&#151;a weight-reducing adaptation for flight.</p>

<p>Many other parts of a bird's anatomy are also modified in some way that reduces weight. The bones have a honeycombed structure that makes them strong but light. For example, the frigate bird found along coastlines in warm climates has a wingspan of about 2 meters, but its whole skeleton weighs only about 100 grams. Another adaptation that reduces weight in birds is the absence of some internal organs found in other vertebrates. Female birds, for instance, have only one ovary instead of a pair. Also, birds are toothless, an adaptation that reduces the weight of the head. Instead, birds have a hard beak and a <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggizzard.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggizzard.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gizzard</a>&#151;a muscular organ, often containing small stones, that grinds seeds and other food. The gizzard is a feature that birds share with crocodiles and alligators. Some dinosaurs also had gizzards. Most birds also have a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcrop.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcrop.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">crop</a>, a sac-like organ used for temporarily storing food (Figure 26-9).</p>

<p>Birds have circulatory systems that are very efficient in delivering oxygen to cells. Like amphibians and reptiles, birds have two pathways of blood flow: one from the heart to the lungs and back, and the other from the heart to the rest of the body and back. But amphibians and most reptiles have three-chambered hearts. In these animals, oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted blood mix in a heart chamber called a ventricle. In contrast, birds have a four-chambered heart with two separate ventricles. This keeps oxygen-rich blood from the lungs separate from the oxygen-depleted blood that passes through the heart. By improving the efficiency of delivering oxygen-rich blood to cells, the four-chambered heart is an adaptation for an active, endothermic lifestyle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Origin of Birds</span><br>
Based on fossils, most paleontologists agree that the ancestor of birds was a type of small, feathered dinosaur. Recent fossil discoveries in China support this hypothesis of a close relationship  between dinosaurs and birds. They show dinosaurs from more than 100 million years ago that are covered from tail to beak with structures that appear to be feathers.</p> 

<p>The most famous bird fossil, <i>Archaeopteryx,</i> represents an animal that lived about 150 million years ago during the Mesozoic Era. Unlike modern birds, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had clawed forelimbs, teeth, and a long tail with vertebrae&#151;all reptilian characteristics. In fact, if the feathers had not been preserved in the fossil, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> probably would have been identified as a small dinosaur. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Birds</span><br>
There are about 9,000 species of birds living today, far outnumbering mammal species. Among those species of birds there is tremendous diversity of flying styles, beak and foot adaptations, and behavioral characteristics.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Flying Styles</span> Birds exhibit several different styles of flying. For example, cardinals and finches rapidly change altitude as they fly. This is an adaptation that helps them avoid predators. Falcons and albatrosses are raptors (hunting birds) that soar, using their wings to gain altitude and then gliding on air currents without flapping. In contrast, hummingbirds flap their wings as many as 80 times per second, which enables them to hover in one spot. Penguins are flightless diving birds that use the same basic flight stroke as other birds to "fly" through the water. Chickens belong to a group of birds that can fly short distances, but are incapable of long flights. Ostriches, emus, and kiwis are birds that cannot fly at all.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Beak Adaptations</span> Birds exhibit a great variety of beak shapes that reflect their various functions. Also called "bills," bird beaks are made of keratin and are tough but fairly lightweight. Bird nostrils, which function in breathing, are located in the beak. Birds do not use their beaks, which are toothless, for chewing. However, some species use their beaks to break apart fruit, seeds, nuts, and other food.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Foot Structures</span> Various birds use their feet for walking, perching on branches, wading, and paddling through water. Feet also function in grasping food, in defense, and in some courtship rituals. Most bird legs and feet are covered in scales. Each foot of most birds has four toes, although some birds, such as the ostrich, have only two toes. The arrangement of toes also varies from species to species (Figure 26-12). Aquatic birds have webbed feet with skin connecting the toes, an adaptation to their paddling lifestyle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Behavioral Adaptations</span> Bird brains are relatively highly developed. Among vertebrates, the size of a bird brain compared to body size is second only to mammals. As a result, birds are capable of complex behavior, especially in elaborate courtship rituals, caring for their young, and communication.</p> 

<p>Generally, male birds attract female mates through a combination of colorful plumage (feathers) and elaborate displays that include "dances." However, one group of birds in Australia and nearby islands builds a hut or platform of twigs called a bower. These bowers are often decorated with colorful items. The male of one species of bower bird even uses a twig as a paintbrush and chewed berries as paint; to paint the interior walls of its bower. The bower functions to attract females.</p>

<p>Another example of complex behavior is caring for offspring. This includes incubating the eggs, often by sitting on them for several weeks. In many species, both the male and female birds take turns incubating the eggs keeping them warm enough for the embryo to develop inside. In many species, when baby chicks are born, the male and female birds take turns foraging for food and bringing it back to the nest.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting behavioral characteristics is bird song. "Songs" are the main method by which birds communicate. The great diversity of songs have a variety of functions&#151;to attract mates, defend territory, and send alarms about danger. Many humans, of course, enjoy hearing the variety of bird songs. More generally, "birdwatching," usually with the help of binoculars, is one of the most popular hobbies in the United States.</p>
