<p>Think of a wild animal or an animal in a zoo. Name a circus animal or the first animal that comes to mind when you think of a pet. In each of these cases, chances are your first thoughts are mammals. Many of the most familiar animals&#151;deer, wolves, elephants, giraffes, tigers, dogs, and cats&#151;are all mammals, and so are you.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Origin and General Characteristics of Mammals</span><br>
The oldest fossils of mammals (class Mammalia) date back about 220 million years to the early Mesozoic Era. The fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that mammals evolved from mammal-like reptiles called therapsids. The early mammals co-existed with dinosaurs throughout the Age of Reptiles. During that time, there was a variety of mouse-sized, insect-eating mammals. The large eye sockets of the fossilized skulls suggest that these tiny mammals were nocturnal (active at night). This characteristic probably helped protect early mammals from carnivorous dinosaurs, which were mostly active during the day. About 65 million years ago, mammals diversified as they adapted to habitats and ecosystem roles that were vacated due to the extinction of dinosaurs.</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmammal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmammal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Mammals</a> are endothermic vertebrates that possess mammary glands and hair. Mammary glands are present in both male and female mammals. However, they do not fully develop in males. Adult female mammals produce milk in mammary glands, and offspring feed on this nutritious milk. Mammal hair, like bird feathers, is made of the protein keratin. Hair may have evolved initially as a sensory adaptation. Evidence of root-like structures in the fossils of some therapsids could indicate the presence of whiskers that functioned in the sense of touch. The main function of hair in modern mammals is to insulate the body and help maintain a warm, constant internal temperature. Some mammals have fur, a dense combination of long and short hairs. Other mammals only have hair on certain parts of their body. A few mammals such as dolphins are mostly hairless, having retained only a few bristles.</p>

<p>Internally, all mammals have lungs, even aquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins. All mammals also have a muscular diaphragm that separates the lungs and heart from the rest of the body cavity. The diaphragm aids in breathing. Like birds, mammals are endothermic and have a four-chambered heart with two separate circuits of blood flow. And like birds and reptiles, mammals reproduce sexually by internal fertilization. Most mammals give birth to young, but one group, about which you will read below, lays eggs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Mammals</span><br>
There are about 4,500 known species of mammals on Earth today. They are divided into three main groups: the monotremes, the marsupials, and placental mammals (Figure 26-15).</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Monotremes</span> Mammals that lay eggs are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmonotre.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmonotre.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">monotremes</a>. Today the only living monotremes are the platypuses and echidnas of Australia and nearby islands. These mammals are unique in their mixture of ancestral reptilian traits and mammalian characteristics. For example, the shoulders and forelimbs of monotremes are angled from the body in a way that is very similar to some reptiles. The eggs of monotremes have relatively soft shells, like those of many reptiles. Monotremes have an exit passage called the cloaca where the digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems all empty. You might recall that reptiles and birds also have cloacas. However, monotremes are classified as mammals because they have hair and the females produce milk.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that monotremes descended from an early branch in the evolution of mammals is supported by molecular evidence. Nucleic acid comparisons suggest that monotremes are the mammals most closely related to reptiles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Marsupials</span> The "pouched mammals," including kangaroos, koalas, and opossums, are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmarsupi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmarsupi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">marsupials</a>. The embryos of these mammals are born before they are fully developed&#151;within 12 to 16 days after fertilization in some species. In most species, the young marsupials complete their development in an external pouch, located on the mother's abdomen. While most marsupials are found in Australia, you may be familiar with one marsupial native to North and South America&#151;the opossum. Opossums have hairless tails that are covered by scales.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Placental Mammals</span> In most mammals, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplacmam.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplacmam.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">placental mammals</a>, the embryo completes its development while protected within the mother's uterus. Inside the uterus, an organ called the placenta provides the embryo with nutrients and oxygen and removes waste products. The embryo is also bathed in fluid contained by a protective membrane, the amnion. The amnion encloses a fluid-filled compartment similar to that in the amniotic eggs of reptiles and birds. 
There are more than 4,200 known species of placental mammals, by far the most diverse of the three main groups of mammals. The following highlights the variety of form and habitat among the placental mammals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Cetacea</span> Whales, dolphins, and porpoises are fish-shaped aquatic mammals with paddle-like forelimbs and no hind limbs. Cetaceans have little hair but have a thick layer of insulating blubber (fat). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit all coastal waters of the world except in polar regions. Dolphins feed on a variety of fishes and mollusks. Groups of dolphins, called pods, have been observed working together to surround schools of fish and herd them into a small circle for easier feeding.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Sirenia</span> Sea cows, or manatees, are aquatic herbivores with finlike forelimbs and no hind limbs. <i>Trichechus manatus</i> is an endangered species of manatee found in coastal waters from the Gulf of Mexico to the Carolinas.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Edentata</span> Sloths (such as the three-toed sloth), anteaters, and armadillos belong to this group of mammals. Mostly insectivores (insect eaters) and herbivores, members of this order inhabit Central and South America and range northward to the south-central United States.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Rodentia</span> There are more about 2,000 species of rodents, including squirrels, beavers, rats, porcupines, and mice. Most have chisel-like front teeth that continually grow and are ideally suited for gnawing. The capybara is the largest species of rodent in the world, weighing as much as an adult human.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Carnivora</span> Dogs, wolves, cats, weasels, otters, seals, walruses, and bears are among the mammals in this order. Members of this group have sharp, pointed teeth for tearing and flattened teeth for chewing. The red panda lives in the mountains of East Asia.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Order Chiroptera</span> Bats are the only mammals capable of true flight. Bats account for nearly 25 percent of all species of placental mammals and have diverse lifestyles. Some bats, such as the lesser long-nosed bat, feed on fruit and nectar. Other bats use sonar to locate insect prey. There are only three species of vampire bats, bats that eat blood. Their range extends from Mexico to South America and they feed mostly on the blood of cattle and other livestock.</p>
