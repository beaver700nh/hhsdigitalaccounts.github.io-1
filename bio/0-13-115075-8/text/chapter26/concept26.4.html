<p>Fossils of humans and human ancestors provide a connection to the past. The fossil record indicates that modern humans have a relatively recent history that began in Africa. In only a short time, humans have become the most numerous and widespread large animal on Earth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Closer Look at Primates</span><br>
The mammals called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprimate.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprimate.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">primates</a> (order Primates) include lemurs, monkeys, apes, and humans. There are approximately 300 primate species living today. Fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that primates evolved from a small tree-dwelling, insect-eating ancestor about 65 million years ago. Recent analysis of molecular data suggests an even earlier origin 85 million years ago.</p>

<p>Primates, even those that now live on the ground, retain adaptations for living in the trees. For example, primates have flexible shoulder joints, which make it possible to swing from one branch to another. The hands of primates can hang onto branches and manipulate food. Many primate species have sensitive fingers with nails instead of claws. Primates have binocular vision, meaning that the two eyes are close together on the front of the face. The fields of vision of the two eyes overlap&#151;like a pair of binoculars&#151;enhancing depth perception, which is the ability to estimate how far away an object is. This is a valuable adaptation for animals that maneuver in trees. The excellent eye-hand coordination of primates is also important for maneuvering in the treetops.</p>

<p>Mammals devote more energy to caring for their young than do most other vertebrates. And primates are among the most attentive parents of all mammals. Most primates have single births and nurture their offspring for a long time.</p>

<p>Biologists divide living primates into two groups. One group includes lorises, galagos, and lemurs. Today lemurs are found on Madagascar island and the Comoro Islands, off the east coast of Africa. Lorises live in Africa and southern Asia. With the exception of some lemurs, most primates of this group are nocturnal tree-dwellers. Many have claws rather than nails.</p>

<p>The second primate group includes tarsiers, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Tarsiers are limited to Southeast Asia, are nocturnal, and have flat faces with large eyes. All New World monkeys&#151;those found in the Americas&#151;are tree-dwelling. Some have <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprehens.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprehens.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">prehensile tails</a> (grasping tails) that function as an extra appendage for swinging through trees. If you see a monkey in a zoo swinging by its tail, you know it's a New World monkey. Although some Old World monkeys are also tree-dwellers, their tails are not prehensile. Many Old World monkeys, including baboons, macaques, and mandrills, are mainly ground-dwellers.</p>

<p>The apes include gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Modern apes live only in tropical regions of the Old World. Except for some gibbons, apes are generally larger than other primates. They have relatively long arms, short legs, and no tail. While all apes can move by swinging through trees, only gibbons and orangutans are mainly tree-dwellers. Gorillas and chimpanzees are highly social. Of all primates, chimpanzees are biologically the closest relatives of humans, differing in about 5 percent of their DNA sequences.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Early Hominids</span><br>
Mammals that are more closely related to humans than to any other species family are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghominid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghominid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hominids</a> (family Hominidae). Only one species of hominid exists today&#151;<i>Homo sapiens,</i> modern humans. However, a diversity of hominids lived in the past, including the probable ancestors of <i>H. sapiens.</i></p>

<p>The earliest hominid may have lived as long as 6 or 7 million years ago. In the summer of 2001, researchers discovered fragments of a skull that old in the desert of northern Chad (a country in Africa). The fossil has certain facial features and teeth that are more hominid-like than ape-like. An important question about this species is whether it was the ancestor of the diverse hominids that appear about a million years later in the fossil record.</p>

<p>Two important developments in the evolution of hominids were upright posture (leading to two-legged walking) and enlargement of the brain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Walking Upright</span> Fossilized bones of a hominid species named  <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> provide the oldest evidence of upright posture and walking on two feet, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbipedal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbipedal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bipedalism</a>. <i>A. afarensis</i> was walking upright at least 4 million years ago. One of the most complete fossil skeletons of <i>A. afarensis</i> dates to about 3.2 million years ago and was found in East Africa. Nicknamed "Lucy" by her discoverers, the individual was a female, only about 3 and a half feet tall, and had a head about the size of a softball.</p>

<p>All <i>Australopithecus</i> species were extinct by about 1.2 million years ago. Some of the later species overlapped in time with early species of the genus <i>Homo.</i> What is the evolutionary relationship of <i>Australopithecus</i> to <i>Homo?</i> Were the different <i>Australopithecus</i> species all evolutionary side branches? Or were some of them ancestors to later humans? Either way, these early hominids indicate that walking upright evolved millions of years before a greatly enlarged brain. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Enlarged Brain</span> An enlarged brain relative to body size in hominids first appears in fossils from East Africa that are about 2.5 million years old. Scientists have found many skulls with braincase sizes that are between those of the most recent <i>Australopithecus</i> species and those of <i>H. sapiens.</i> Simple handmade stone tools are sometimes found with the larger-brained fossils of this species, which has been named <i>Homo habilis</i> ("handy man"). About 2 million years after first walking upright, the ancestors of modern humans were using their skilled hands and big brains to invent tools (Figure 26-22). These tools probably enhanced the ability to hunt, gather, and scavenge for food.</p>

<p>The first hominid species to appear as fossils on continents other than Africa was <i>Homo erectus.</i> <i>H. erectus</i> was taller than <i>H. habilis</i> and had a larger brain (Figure 26-23). During the 1.5 million years the species existed, the <i>H. erectus</i> brain increased to as large as 1,200 cubic centimeters, within the normal range for modern humans. Increased intelligence enabled humans to continue their success in Africa and also to survive in the colder climates of the north. One hypothesis about the spread of humans from Africa about 1.8 million years ago centers on the gradual change in diet to include a larger proportion of meat. In general, hunting for food requires living in a larger territory than does feeding on plants. However, in 2001 researchers found skulls that may challenge the view that <i>H. erectus</i> was the first hominid to leave Africa. In the country of Georgia, near Russia, hominid skulls have been found with relatively small brain cases. Some scientists have inferred from these finds that a <i>H. habilis</i>-like ancestor may have been the first hominid to leave Africa.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Origin of Modern Humans</span><br>
The fossil record suggests that <i>H. erectus</i> gave rise to diverse hominids in different regions. For example, the Neanderthals were <i>H. erectus</i> descendants who lived in what are now Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The oldest fully-modern fossils of <i>H. sapiens</i>&#151;skulls and other bones that look like those of today's humans&#151;are about 100,000 years old and were discovered in Africa. Similar fossils almost as old have been discovered in Israel. </p>

<p>There are two hypotheses for the origin of fully-modern humans from earlier hominids. According to the "multiregional hypothesis," fully-modern humans evolved in several parts of the world from <i>Homo erectus</i> descendants that spread from Africa over 1.5 million years ago. Occasional inbreeding among regional populations could explain how <i>H. sapiens</i> evolved as a single species. But according to the second hypothesis, all regional descendants of <i>H. erectus,</i> outside of Africa, including the Neanderthals, became extinct. According to this view, fully-modern humans evolved from a population of <i>H. erectus</i> descendants that remained in Africa. These fully-modern humans spread out of Africa less than 100,000 years ago, "replacing" the then-extinct descendants of the much earlier <i>H. erectus</i> migration. Comparisons of DNA samples from human populations around the world today support a very recent split from a common ancestor. This molecular evidence favors the "replacement hypothesis."</p>

<p>When you review these two chapters on vertebrates, you can trace human ancestry back to the earliest animals with backbones. To help with your review, Figure 26-24 summarizes the body systems of the major vertebrate groups.</p>
