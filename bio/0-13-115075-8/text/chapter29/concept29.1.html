<p>Think about sliding a warm, tasty slice of cheese pizza into your mouth. You take a bite, chew, and swallow. You probably aren't saying to yourself, "There, I'm providing my cells with nutrients." However, that's exactly what you're doing. But first, your digestive system must disassemble the pizza into basic building blocks that your cells can use.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Food As a Source of Nutrients</span><br>
Like all heterotrophs, humans obtain nutrients from food. These nutrients are the source of raw materials that your body uses to build tissue and fuel cellular work. There are six types of nutrients in food: carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water (Figure 29-1).</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>However, the food you eat is usually "packaged" in bulk form&#151;like the slice of pizza&#151;and contains large, complex molecules. These large molecules, such as starch and other polymers, are too big to pass through membranes into the cells where they are needed. In addition, the polymers are not the same polymers that make up your body. For example, the cheese on a slice of pizza is partly made up of proteins. These cheese proteins are polymers that can't be used as is by your cells. Instead, the cheese proteins must be broken down into their basic building blocks (monomers)&#151;amino acids. As you read in Chapter 5, all organisms use the same monomers to build larger polymers. So, the amino acids that make up cheese proteins are the same ones your cells can use to build your body's "brand" of proteins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Four Stages of Food Processing</span><br>
The process of how your body obtains raw materials from food is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnutriti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnutriti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nutrition</a>. This process involves the four stages shown in Figure 29-2. The first is very familiar to you&#151;eating. The act of eating or drinking is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gingesti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gingesti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ingestion</a>. </p>

					<p align="center"><table width="210" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-02.gif" width="210" height="310" ALT="Figure 29-2"></td>

<p>After food enters the body through ingestion, the next stage of food processing, digestion, begins. <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdigesti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdigesti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Digestion</a> is the process of breaking food down into molecules small enough for the body to absorb. For example, polysaccharides such as the starch in the pizza crust are broken down into monosaccharides (simple sugars).</p>

<p>Digestion occurs in two steps. Mechanical digestion (such as chewing) chops and grinds food into smaller pieces, increasing its surface area. This improves the effectiveness of the second step, chemical digestion. Chemical digestion breaks the chemical bonds within the large molecules that make up food, producing smaller building-block molecules. An example of chemical digestion is the action of acids and enzymes in your stomach.</p>

<p>The last two stages of food processing occur after food is digested. In the third stage, <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gabsorpt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gabsorpt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">absorption</a>, certain cells take up (absorb) the small molecules. The circulatory system then transports the nutrients throughout the body. Finally, undigested material passes out of the body in the stage called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gelimina.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gelimina.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">elimination</a>. In Concept 29.2, you'll read how the organs of the digestive system participate in these four stages.</p>
