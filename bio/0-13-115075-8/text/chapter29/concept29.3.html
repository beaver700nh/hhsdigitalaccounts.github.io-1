<p>Why do you need to eat? Your body is constantly working, even while you are sleeping. To do that work, your body needs food to burn as fuel for energy. Food is also a source of molecular building blocks that your body can use to manufacture other molecules it needs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Food As Fuel</span><br>
The building blocks of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats can all be used by cells to generate ATP by cellular respiration (as you read in Chapter 7). Fats are especially rich in energy, containing more than twice the energy of carbohydrates per gram. The energy content of food is measured in kilocalories (1 kilocalorie = 1000 calories). (Remember that one calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius.) The calories listed on food labels or referred to elsewhere regarding nutrition are actually kilocalories and are written as "Calories" (with a capital "C").</p>

<p>Each person must consume a minimum amount of Calories every day just to maintain the metabolic processes that sustain life. For this basic maintenance plus energy needed for an active lifestyle, teenagers require about 2,200 Calories for females and 2,500 Calories for males. Figure 29-9 lists the specific Calorie requirements for several different activities.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Essential Nutrients</span><br>
Besides fuel and carbon skeletons, your diet must also supply essential nutrients. <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gessenti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gessenti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Essential nutrients</a> are materials that must be ingested because your cells cannot construct them from other molecules.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Essential Fatty Acids</span> Your cells make fats and certain other lipids by combining fatty acids with other molecules, such as glycerol. Your cells can manufacture most of the required fatty acids from simpler molecules. The fatty acids that your body can <i>not</i> make are essential fatty acids, which means that they must be obtained from your diet. An example is linoleic acid, which is required to make the phospholipids that make up your cells' plasma membranes. Most people's diets in the United States provide enough essential fatty acids, so deficiencies are rare.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Essential Amino Acids</span> Of the 20 amino acids required to manufacture all the proteins your body needs, eight cannot be made by your cells from other organic molecules. Those eight are called essential amino acids. A deficiency in even one of them impairs protein synthesis. (Infants require a ninth essential amino acid, histidine, that their cells start to make as they grow older.) The body cannot store excess amino acids, making it important for your daily diet to contain the essential ones. Animal products such as meat, eggs, and cheese provide all eight. People who do not eat animal products must eat the right combinations of plant foods to obtain all the essential amino acids (Figure 29-10).</p>

						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Vitamins</span> Vitamins are organic molecules that are required in relatively small amounts and partner with enzymes (Figure 29-11). Vitamin deficiencies can cause health problems. For example, a lack of vitamin A can cause vision problems.</p>


					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-11.gif" width="525" height="364" ALT="Figure 29-11"></td>

								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>There are two main classes of vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins cannot be stored by your body, while fat-soluble vitamins can. If you ingest more water-soluble vitamins than you need each day, the excess will be eliminated in your urine. However, if you ingest more fat-soluble vitamins than you need, the excess will be stored. Over time, these stored vitamins can build up and cause health problems. For example, an extreme excess of vitamin A can cause hair loss, blurred vision, and liver damage.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Minerals</span> Elements you require in inorganic form are called minerals (Figure 29-12). Like vitamins, you only need small quantities of most minerals. However, your body needs larger amounts of some minerals, such as calcium, which is important for making bone tissue and for nerve and muscle function. Also like vitamins, a deficiency in any one mineral can cause serious health problems. Recall from Chapter 27 that a calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis.</p>

									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-12.gif" width="380" height="394" ALT="Figure 29-12"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 29-12<br>Minerals play important roles in a range of body functions.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Minerals can also be harmful if they are consumed in high quantities. For example, excessive sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure in some individuals. Sodium is found in high levels in most prepared foods. As a result, the average American consumes 20 times the required amount of sodium.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Food Guide Pyramid</span><br>
One way to learn how much of each type of food to eat is to study the Food Guide Pyramid (Figure 29-13). The pyramid shape indicates the recommended proportions of different types of food in a healthy diet. For example, notice that foods such as bread, rice, and pasta make up the pyramid's wide base. This indicates that these foods should make up the largest proportion of a person's daily diet. The foods in the tip of the pyramid (fats, oils, and sweets) should only make up a very small part of the diet. The number of small triangle and circle symbols in each block of the pyramid signifies the amount of fats and sugars in that type of food.</p>


						<p align="center"><table width="385" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-13.gif" width="385" height="331" ALT="Figure 29-13"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 29-13<br>Following the recommendations of this Food Guide Pyramid will help you maintain a healthy and balanced diet.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>To fully understand and use the Food Guide Pyramid, it is important to know what is meant by a "serving" of each type of food. In some cases, a serving is less than you might expect. For example, one serving of bread is a single piece. One serving of meat, poultry, or fish equals 2 or 3 ounces. That's about the size of one medium chicken thigh. So, eating two or three chicken thighs would satisfy your daily requirement in this food group.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Food Labels</span><br>
Perhaps you've noticed information labels like the one in Figure 29-14 printed on food containers. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all packaged food be labeled with detailed nutritional information. This information is presented in blocks of data.</p>

						<p align="center"><table width="375" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-14.gif" width="225" height="522" ALT="Figure 29-14"></td>
									<td align="left" valign="top"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 29-14<br>The standard Nutrition Facts food label was developed to help consumers make healthy and educated choices.</span></td>
								</tr>
					</table></p>

<p>Section A of the label indicates the size of a single serving  and also how many servings are in the package. Section B indicates the total Calories in one serving of the food, as well as how many Calories are from fat. Section C provides more detail, including how many grams (g) or milligrams (mg) of fat, carbohydrate, and protein are contained in one serving. It also indicates what percentage of the Daily Value is provided in one serving. For example, one serving of this vegetable pizza contains 7 g of fat. Experts recommend that a person eating a 2,000 Calorie per day diet ingest no more than 30 percent from fat, or no more than 600 Calories from fat.  Seven grams of fat provides approximately 63 Calories. (Section F lists how many Calories are contained in one gram of fat, carbohydrate, and protein). So, one serving provides approximately 11 percent of that person's Daily Value of fat.</p>

<p>Section D provides percentage of Daily Value information for key vitamins and minerals. For example, one serving of this pizza provides 20 percent of the Daily Value of vitamin C and 15 percent of the Daily Value of calcium (for a person consuming 2,000 Calories per day). Section E provides general information on recommended daily nutrient intake for people who require 2,000 or 2,500 Calories per day. Finally, Section G lists all the ingredients in the food, from the most abundant to the least. For instance, wheat flour is the most abundant ingredient in this vegetable pizza.</p>

<p>Eating a balanced diet is key to providing your body with the energy and building blocks it needs. In Concept 29.4, you will learn about the negative health effects of not eating the right amounts of healthy foods.</p>
