<p>How is your digestive system like an automobile factory that is running in reverse? If an automobile assembly line operated in reverse, the workers would start with a complete car and disassemble it into individual parts, or building blocks. Your body processes food in a similar manner. As food travels through your digestive system, it is broken into its basic building blocks.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Digestion Occurs in a Tube</span><br>
Digestion occurs in a tube called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/galiment.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/galiment.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">alimentary canal</a>. Food moves in one direction through the alimentary canal, which is organized into specialized regions that carry out digestion and absorption in a step-by-step process. Food enters the canal through the mouth and wastes leave through the anus. However, the alimentary canal is much longer than the distance between these two openings. For instance, a person 1.8 meters tall can have a 9-meter alimentary canal. The tube fits inside the body because portions wind and loop back and forth.</p>

<p>As you read in Chapter 27, epithelial tissue lines the alimentary canal. One function of the epithelial cells is to secrete mucus that lubricates the canal and helps prevent the body from digesting itself. This is important because the digestive juices in your stomach, for example, have a pH of 2&#151;acidic enough to dissolve iron nails. Despite the mucous layer, the epithelial cells in the stomach are constantly eroded. Enough new cells are generated through mitosis to completely replace your stomach lining every three days.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Organs of the Digestive System</span><br>
Six main organs make up the alimentary canal: the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (Figure 29-3). Accessory glands and organs include the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, which secrete digestive juices into the alimentary canal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mouth</span> Your mouth functions both in ingestion and in the beginning of digestion. Your teeth and tongue are responsible for mechanical digestion (Figure 29-4). The various shapes of different types of teeth cut, smash, and grind food into smaller pieces. This makes the food easier to swallow and exposes more surface area to digestive enzymes.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>Chemical digestion also begins in your mouth.  In a typical day, salivary glands in your mouth region secrete more than one liter of liquid. This liquid, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsaliva.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsaliva.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">saliva</a>, contains digestive enzymes, mucus, and other chemicals. The salivary enzyme called amylase begins the chemical digestion of the polysaccharide starch in foods like pizza crust, pasta, and bread. The main products of amylase's action are smaller polysaccharides and the disaccharide maltose. Other chemicals in saliva kill bacteria and neutralize certain acids in foods, protecting your teeth from decay.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Pharynx</span> The tongue pushes each chewed clump of food, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbolus.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbolus.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bolus</a>, down the throat. The upper portion of the throat, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpharynx.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpharynx.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pharynx</a> (FAR ingks), is the junction of the alimentary canal and the passageway by which air enters the lungs. When you swallow, a cartilage flap called the epiglottis temporarily seals off the airway and prevents food from entering. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Esophagus</span> Next, the bolus enters a long, muscle-encased tube called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gesophag.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gesophag.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">esophagus</a> (ih SAHF uh gus), which connects the pharynx to the stomach. Although the esophagus is oriented vertically in your body, gravity is not the reason that food moves toward your stomach. (If that were the case, astronauts would not be able to eat or drink in space where there is zero gravity.) Rather, food is pushed through the esophagus by a series of muscle contractions called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gperista.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gperista.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">peristalsis</a> (Figure 29-5). The muscles at the very top of the esophagus are striated (voluntary), which means that swallowing begins voluntarily. But the muscle layers around the rest of the esophagus are smooth (involuntary). Once a bolus of food reaches the pharynx these smooth muscles trigger the swallowing reflex. The smooth muscles contract in a wave-like motion that forces the bolus of food toward the stomach. Food continues to move along the alimentary canal by peristalsis.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Stomach</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstomach.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstomach.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stomach</a> is an elastic, muscular sac capable of stretching to hold up to 2 liters of food (an entire medium-sized pizza). A liquid called gastric juice, secreted by glands in the stomach lining, bathes the bolus after it enters the stomach. Gastric juice is a mixture of mucus, hydrochloric acid, and enzymes. Hydrochloric acid breaks apart the cells in food. It also kills many of the bacteria swallowed with food. One of the gastric enzymes, pepsin, hydrolyzes large protein molecules into smaller polypeptides.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, mechanical digestion turns the bolus into an acidic liquid called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gchyme.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gchyme.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">chyme</a> (kym). Stomach muscles contract, creating a churning motion that stirs the chyme and eventually forces it into the small intestine.</p>

<p>Most of the time, the stomach is pinched closed at both ends (Figure 29-6). The passageway between the esophagus and the stomach opens when peristalsis delivers a bolus. But in some people, the passageway may open at inappropriate times, allowing acidic chyme to flow backward into the esophagus. This creates a burning sensation called heartburn.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>At the opposite end of the stomach, a muscular valve called the pyloric sphincter regulates the flow of chyme into the small intestine. It typically takes 2 to 6 hours after a meal for the stomach to empty.</p>
					
<p><span class="setextsubsm">Small Intestine, Liver, and Pancreas</span> From the stomach, liquid chyme passes into the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsmallin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsmallin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">small intestine</a>. The small intestine is a long (6 m), narrow (2.5 cm) tube where digestion is completed and absorption of most nutrients takes place. Peristalsis moves chyme along the small intestine. Digestion mostly occurs in the first portion of the small intestine, while absorption occurs along the rest of its length.</p>

<p>The first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum. As chyme enters the duodenum, it mixes with several digestive juices. One of these digestive juices is a liquid called bile. Bile is produced outside of the small intestine by the body's largest internal organ, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/gliver.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/gliver.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">liver</a>. Bile is stored in a sac-like structure called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggallbla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggallbla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gallbladder</a> until it is secreted into the duodenum. Although bile contains no enzymes, it contains substances that help prepare fats such as those in butter, ice cream, and nuts for digestion. Fats tend to clump together into globs, making it difficult for enzymes to reach the molecules. Bile separates small fat droplets, preventing them from clumping into globs. This enables digestive enzymes to break the fats down more efficiently.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpancrea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpancrea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pancreas</a> produces and secretes pancreatic juice into the duodenum. Pancreatic juice neutralizes the acid chyme and also contains enzymes that hydrolyze carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Other pancreatic enzymes, along with enzymes secreted by the lining of the small intestine, complete the chemical digestion of food.</p>

<p>As an end result of digestion, carbohydrates are hydrolyzed to monosaccharides. Monosaccharides provide your cells with a source of energy. They are also a source of carbon skeletons (chains of carbon atoms) for constructing other organic molecules. The complete digestion of proteins results in individual amino acids. As you have already read, your cells use these amino acids to build their own "brand" of proteins. Lastly, the hydrolysis of fats by the enzyme lipase (which is secreted by the pancreas) results in fatty acids and glycerol. Your cells use these raw materials to build their own lipids.</p>

<p>The small intestine is highly specialized for absorbing nutrients into the circulatory and lymphatic systems for transport (Figure 29-7). The wall of the small intestine is folded into many small, finger-like projections called <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvillus.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvillus.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">villi</a> (singular, <i>villus</i>). The epithelial cells lining each villus have microscopic projections called microvilli. The total surface area of all the villi in the small intestine is about equal to that of a tennis court!</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="29images/29-07.gif" width="525" height="271" ALT="Figure 29-7"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 29-7<br>Nutrient absorption occurs in the epithelial cells of the small intestine.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>At its core, each villus has a small lymph vessel and a network of capillaries (microscopic blood vessels). After fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed by an epithelial cell, these building blocks are recombined into fats that are then transported into the lymph vessel. Sugars and amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries in each villus.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Large Intestine</span> By the time food reaches the end of the small intestine, the nutrients have all been broken down and absorbed. Undigested material passes through another sphincter from the small intestine into the <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glargein.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glargein.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">large intestine</a>. Also called the colon, the large intestine is a wide (5 cm), short (1.5 m) tube from which water is absorbed into the body. The large intestine also contains certain bacteria that produce vitamin K and several B vitamins.</p>

<p>As you have read, a major function of the large intestine is to reabsorb water. Saliva, gastric juice, and other digestive juices all contain large amounts of water. Altogether about 7 liters of fluid are secreted into the alimentary canal each day. Much of that water is reabsorbed along with nutrients in the small intestine. The large intestine finishes the job by absorbing most of the remaining water. Together the small intestine and large intestine reclaim 90 percent of the water that enters the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>Undigested food material and other waste products are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfeces.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfeces.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">feces</a>. Reabsorption of water causes the feces to become more solid as it moves through the large intestine. Once again, peristalsis is the mechanism that moves this material through the large intestine. It generally takes 12 to 24 hours for waste material to travel through the colon.</p>
