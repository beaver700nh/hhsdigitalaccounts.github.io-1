<p>Diets lacking in essential nutrients result in health problems. In addition, the body has a basic Calorie requirement to function. What happens when the body receives too few&#151;or too many&#151;Calories?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Malnutrition</span><br>
A diet lacking one or more essential nutrients can result in <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmalnutr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmalnutr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">malnutrition</a>. For example, a deficiency in vitamin C can result in scurvy, a disease that causes swollen gums, loose teeth, and small black and blue spots on the skin. Sailors prior to the 1800s often suffered from scurvy because on their long journeys they had no source of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide vitamin C. Today, malnutrition due to protein deficiency is a serious problem in certain parts of the world. For example, higher death rates among children are common in countries where nutrient-rich food is scarce.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Undernutrition</span><br>
A person whose diet is deficient in Calories is suffering from <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gundernu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gundernu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">undernutrition</a>. Eventually the body begins breaking down its own protein molecules for fuel. Muscles shrink and the body may even break down its own tissues to supply energy. Undernutrition usually occurs in parts of the world where drought, war, or some other crisis has disrupted the food supply. </p>


<p>Even simple diets consisting only of rice or corn can provide an adequate number of Calories. However, such diets may be deficient in various nutrients.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Obesity</span><br>
Consistently ingesting more Calories than are needed can also cause health problems. The human body stores excess Calories as fat until that energy is needed. Health experts generally agree that females can safely have 20-25 percent body fat. Males can safely have 15-19 percent body fat. According to a recent government study, more than 60 percent of Americans are overweight, including 13 percent of children and teens. <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gobesity.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gobesity.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Obesity</a> is the condition of being seriously overweight, which can have serious negative effects on health, including increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and asthma. Most obesity is the result of an imbalance between Calories consumed and amount of exercise. In some cases, genetic and psychological factors play a role.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Eating Disorders</span><br>
Eating disorders are psychological conditions that affect a person's eating habits and ability to obtain nutrients. Anorexia and bulimia are the two most common disorders. While they do affect males, these conditions affect a higher percentage of the females in the United States (as many as 4 percent, or more than 7 million women and girls).</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganorexi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganorexi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Anorexia</a> is an extreme pursuit of thinness characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss. A person suffering from anorexia does not consume enough Calories to maintain normal body weight. This condition can lead to disintegration of body organs, menstrual irregularities in women, irregular heartbeat, and even heart failure.</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbulimia.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbulimia.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Bulimia</a> is an eating disorder characterized by purging after bingeing (eating excessively). Purging by vomiting or using laxatives results in the premature elimination of food before the body is able to absorb its nutrients. While bulimics do not always appear extremely thin, a bulimic person will often suffer the same health disorders as an anorexic.</p>

<p>A third type of eating disorder is bingeing without purging. As a binge eater consumes excessive Calories, this condition can lead to obesity.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Healthy Eating for Life</span><br>
Throughout your reading in this chapter you have probably noticed some themes that can help you make healthy decisions about food. One theme is the need for balance between Calories consumed in food and Calories spent in daily activities and exercise. Another theme is the need for a variety of foods in your diet and attention to the amounts of different kinds of foods. One way to get the information you need to make healthy choices is to use the Food Guide Pyramid and to read food labels.</p>
