<p>Not long ago, in geologic terms, the atoms of the organic molecules in your body were parts of the inorganic compounds of soil, air, and water. Life depends on the cycling of chemical elements between the biological and nonliving parts of ecosystems. Prokaryotes play a vital role in chemical recycling.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Chemical Recycling</span><br>
Many prokaryotes perform an essential function by breaking down, or decomposing, organic waste products and dead organisms in the environment. For example, heterotrophic prokaryotes consume complex organic molecules and return carbon to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. If it were not for decomposers, organic wastes and dead organisms would literally pile up on Earth. The atoms composing them would not become available for reuse by later generations of organisms.</p>

<p>You have read how cyanobacteria restore oxygen to the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Some species of bacteria convert nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds in soil and water. This converted nitrogen can be used by plants. In fact, all the nitrogen that plants use to make proteins and nucleic acids is first processed by prokaryotes. That nitrogen is then passed on to animals when they eat the plants. Chapter 36 describes the chemical cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen in more detail.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Human Uses of Prokaryotes</span><br>
Humans have discovered many ways of using prokaryotes. For example, the use of organisms to remove pollutants from water, air, and soil is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbioreme.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbioreme.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bioremediation</a>. One example of bioremediation is the treatment of sewage. In treatment plants, raw sewage first passes through a series of screens and shredders. Solid matter settles out from the liquid waste. This solid matter, called sludge, is then gradually added to a mixture of anaerobic prokaryotes. The prokaryotes decompose the organic matter in the sludge. The resulting material can be used as landfill or fertilizer after it is sterilized.</p>

<p>Biologists have also had some success using the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas</i> to clean up oil spills on beaches. More common still is the use of certain prokaryotes to clean up old mining sites. The water that drains from mines is highly acidic and laced with chemicals such as arsenic, copper, zinc, lead, and mercury. These toxic substances can contaminate nearby soil and groundwater. Cleaning these sites has traditionally been very expensive. But using prokaryotes may cut those costs. For example, some companies are using bacteria called <i>Thiobacillus,</i> which thrive in the acidic waters of mines, to extract lead and mercury from mine runoff. Unfortunately, the use of these bacteria is limited because their metabolic processes also add sulfuric acid to the water. If this problem is solved, perhaps through genetic engineering, <i>Thiobacillus</i> and other prokaryotes may help overcome some serious environmental problems.</p>

<p>In another example of the usefulness of prokaryotes, pharmaceutical companies raise bacteria that make vitamins and antibiotics. And as described in Chapter 13, genetic engineering involves using prokaryotes to make copies of eukaryotic genes and proteins for uses that are just beginning to be explored.</p>
