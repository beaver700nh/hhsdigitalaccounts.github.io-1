<p>As you've read, prokaryotes are very small. However, viruses are even smaller. In fact, a virus isn't even a cell. Since a virus cannot reproduce on its own, it must infect and use living cells to reproduce. Nearly all cells are vulnerable to infection by specific viruses.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Virus Structure and Reproduction</span><br>
The structure of a virus is well-suited to its function: entering a host cell and reproducing. A virus is composed of a relatively short piece of nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat (Figure 16-20). Some viruses also have outer membranes that merge with a host cell's membrane, making it easier for the virus to infect the cell. Since a virus doesn't have its own cellular machinery, it must use the host cell's machinery to make copies of itself.</p>

<p>Early research on viruses that infect bacteria (called bacteriophages, or phages for short) uncovered two basic ways that viruses reproduce. As an example, Figure 16-21 shows these two reproductive cycles for a type of phage that infects <i>E. coli.</i> </p>

The host cell's enzymes and synthesis machinery make copies of the viral DNA and viral proteins. The viral proteins and nucleic acids then assemble themselves inside the host cell, making many copies of the original infecting virus. The host cell then bursts open, releasing hundreds of new viruses. These offspring infect new host cells and repeat the cycle.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glysogen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glysogen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lysogenic cycle</a>, a virus injects its genes into the host. The viral DNA then adds itself directly to the host cell's DNA. Each time the host cell reproduces, the viral DNA is copied along with the host's DNA. Occasionally, the viral DNA separates from the host DNA and starts a lytic cycle. New phages are then made and released.</p>

<p>Some viruses that infect animals have even more complex life cycles. For example, the herpes viruses that cause chicken pox and cold sores reproduce in the host cell's nucleus. The outer coat of these viruses comes from the host cell's nuclear membrane. While inside the nucleus, the herpes DNA may insert itself into the cell's DNA and remain dormant within the body. From time to time, physical stress such as sunburn or emotional stress may cause the herpes DNA to begin production of the virus, resulting in unpleasant symptoms such as cold sores. Once acquired, herpes infections may flare up repeatedly throughout a person's life.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Viruses and Disease</span><br>
In your life you have probably suffered from the flu, caused by a variety of influenza (flu) virus (Figure 16-22). Like many animal viruses, this one has an outer envelope made of a phospholipid membrane with projecting spikes of protein. The envelope helps the virus enter and leave a cell. Also, like many other animal viruses, flu viruses use RNA rather than DNA as their genetic material. Other RNA viruses include those that cause the common cold, measles, and mumps, as well as ones that cause more serious human diseases, such as AIDS and polio. Diseases caused by DNA viruses include hepatitis and herpes infections.</p>

<p>The way viruses cause disease is radically different from the way bacteria cause disease. A disease-causing virus uses the equipment of the host cell to reproduce. Therefore, the approaches to control and cure viral infections are different from bacterial infection controls. You may recall from your own experience with the common cold that you must wait for your body's defense system to destroy the virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses. This is because antibiotics target specific parts of bacterial cells that are not found in either a virus or the cells in your body that host the virus.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">HIV: A Retrovirus</span><br>
The disease called AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a serious viral disease because, as its name implies, it attacks cells of the immune system. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the name of the specific virus that results in AIDS. HIV is an example of an RNA virus. HIV has a membranous envelope that helps the virus recognize host cells and merge with the host cell membrane, delivering the contents of the virus to the host cell.</p>

<p>Figure 16-24 shows the life cycle of HIV. Notice that HIV carries two copies of its RNA genome rather than one. HIV is a <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gretrovi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gretrovi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">retrovirus</a>. Retroviruses are so named because they reverse the usual DNA-to-RNA flow of genetic information in the process called transcription that you read about in Chapter 11. Retroviruses carry molecules of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that catalyze <i>reverse transcription,</i> the synthesis of DNA from an RNA template.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="16images/16-24.gif" width="525" height="361" ALT="Figure 16-24"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 16-24<br>HIV, a retrovirus, uses immune system cells to reproduce itself. These host cells are eventually destroyed, weakening the patient's immune system.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>After HIV enters a host cell, the protein coat surrounding the RNA is removed. The reverse transcriptase uses the RNA as a template to make a double-stranded viral DNA molecule. The double-stranded DNA then enters the nucleus and integrates itself into the host cell DNA, like the lysogenic viruses described earlier. The viral DNA can remain in the host cell for years, but occasionally it is transcribed into RNA. The cell then makes new virus particles that leave (or bud off) the host cell and infect new cells. When the virus remains inactive in the host cell DNA, the disease symptoms are not evident. Only when the virus reproduces and destroys host cells does the immune system become damaged, and the individual becomes ill with AIDS.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Defense Against Viral Diseases</span><br>
For the same reason that good hygiene helps control bacterial diseases, it also limits the spread of viral diseases. The immune system is also critical to fighting viral infections and provides the basis for the major medical weapon for preventing certain viral and bacterial infections from occurring at all&#150;vaccines. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvaccine.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvaccine.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vaccines</a> are deactivated varieties or small pieces of pathogens that stimulate the immune system to defend against the actual pathogen.</p>

<p>The first vaccine was made against the virus that causes smallpox, an often fatal disease. In the late 1700s, Edward Jenner, an English physician, learned that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox (a milder disease that usually infects cows) were resistant to later infections of smallpox. In a famous experiment, Jenner scratched a farmboy with a needle containing fluid from the sore of a milkmaid who had cowpox. When the boy was later exposed to smallpox, he resisted the disease (Figure 16-25). The cowpox and smallpox viruses are so similar that the immune system cannot distinguish them. Vaccination with the cowpox virus "fools" the immune system, which reacts and defends the body if it is ever exposed to the actual smallpox virus. Vaccines have since been developed against several other viral diseases, including polio, measles, and mumps, and against certain bacterial diseases such as whooping cough.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>Although vaccines can prevent certain viral illnesses, they are not effective in preventing others. Some viruses, including the common cold virus and HIV, mutate rapidly. The resulting new strains are not recognized by a previously vaccinated immune system. This means that vaccines could not protect you from every existing strain and could quickly become outdated.</p>

<p>Medical technology can do little, at present, to cure most viral infections. The antibiotics that help you recover from bacterial infections are powerless against viruses. However, a few drugs have been developed that do combat viruses, primarily by interfering with their nucleic acid synthesis or with the action of reverse transcriptase. In Chapter 31, you will learn more about the immune system and why HIV makes the body so vulnerable to other diseases.</p>
