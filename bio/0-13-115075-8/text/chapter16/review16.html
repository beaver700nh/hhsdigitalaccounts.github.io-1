<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>17.</b> Copy this simplified diagram of the life cycle of a retrovirus and fill in the blank boxes. Write a sentence explaining each statement you entered into the boxes. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>18. Analyzing Graphs</b> Examine the graph below to answer the questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> How many bacteria were produced during the second hour?<br>
<b>b.</b> At this rate, how many bacteria would be present at the end of 4 hours?<br>
<b>c.</b> What type of a bacterial reproduction that you read about in this chapter would account for this type of rapid growth?<br>
<b>d.</b> If one cell became resistant to an antibiotic due to a mutation at the 80-minute mark, how many cells would be resistant at the end of the 180-minute mark? (Assume the same growth rate.)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="16images/16-cr-18.gif" width="300" height="220" alt="graph of bacterial growth"></p>

<p><b>19. Analyzing Photographs</b> Look at the photograph of the bacteria below and answer the following questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> Based on the colors of these bacteria, what testing method was used on this slide?<br>
<b>b.</b> What inferences can you make about the cell walls of these bacteria?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="16images/16-cr-19.jpg" width="200" height="168" alt="photo of bacteria"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>20. Evaluating Models</b> Describe the model Stanley Miller built to simulate the different conditions thought to have existed on early Earth. Explain what inference he reached based on this model.</p>
  
<p><b>21. Developing Hypotheses</b> Reread the description in Concept 16.5 about Edward Jenner's experiment with cowpox and smallpox viruses. Write a hypothesis that states the idea Jenner was testing when he performed his experiment.</p>

<p><b>22. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Discuss the similarities and differences between the ways that bacteria and viruses cause disease, and the ways that those diseases are treated.</p>

<p><b>23. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> All bacteria cause disease.<br>
<b>b.</b> Viruses are living cells.<br>
<b>c.</b> Antibiotics will cure a cold.<br> 
<b>d.</b> Bacteria are closely related to eukaryotes. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Writing</b> The average diameters of a human cell, a bacterial cell, and a virus are about 50&#181;m, 5&#181;m, and 0.5&#181;m, respectively. Use this information to select household or classroom objects with which you can model these size differences on a larger scale. Write a paragraph to accompany your model, explaining how you chose your objects and how your model is useful in making comparisons between cells and viruses.</p>
