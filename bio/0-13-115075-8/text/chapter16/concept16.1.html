<p>As you learned in Chapter 15, scientific evidence indicates that Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. Think of a time scale that compresses Earth's entire history into one year&#150;365 days. On this scale Earth formed at midnight on January 1. The time you are living in right now is 11:59:59&#150;one second before midnight on December 31. When did life begin in this "year"?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Oldest Fossils</span><br>
On this one-year time scale, Earth's crust began to cool and solidify in early February&#150;about 400 million years after the planet formed. Fossil evidence indicates that life existed by late March (about 3.5 billion years ago). These ancient fossils are found in dome-shaped rocks called stromatolites. <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstromat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstromat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Stromatolites</a> are composed of thin layers of sediment pressed tightly together, resembling the layers of an onion. The structure of stromatolites is very similar to the layered mats formed by colonies of photosynthetic prokaryotes living today in salty marshes. Fossils resembling photosynthetic prokaryotes have been found in stromatolites that scientists have measured to be about 3.5 billion years old. Recall from Chapter 6 that prokaryotes are simple organisms that lack true nuclei and many of the organelles found in eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Today, photosynthetic prokaryotes are among the simplest organisms that can produce their own food. However, photosynthesis is a complex process, and it is not likely that photosynthetic bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth. The evidence that photosynthetic prokaryotes existed 3.5 billion years ago suggests that life in simpler forms began even earlier, perhaps around mid-February (3.9 billion years ago), when Earth had cooled enough for liquid water to exist.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Did Life Begin?</span><br>
How do scientists study how early forms of life arose on Earth? After all, no people were there to see it happen. But researchers can still apply the scientific process to investigate this mystery&#150;forming hypotheses and designing experiments to test them.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Origin of Small Organic Molecules</span> One important question is how organic compounds first formed before there was life on early Earth. Geologic evidence suggests that the young Earth was a very different place from the planet today. The atmosphere contained carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor, but little or no oxygen. Also, energy sources such as active volcanoes, lightning, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun were all more intense than they are today.</p>

<p>In 1953, Stanley Miller, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, designed an experiment that simulated conditions on early Earth (Figure 16-2). Miller placed gases in a flask to represent Earth's ancient atmosphere. He used electric sparks to represent lightning as an energy source. The experiment produced a variety of small organic molecules that are essential to life, including amino acids&#150;the building blocks of proteins. Many scientists have since repeated and extended this research. They have tested a variety of assumptions about available atmospheric gases and energy sources. Under many different conditions, these experiments have produced all 20 amino acids, several sugars, lipids, the nitrogenous bases found in DNA and RNA, and even ATP.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Formation of Organic Polymers</span> Miller's experiment provided evidence that small organic molecules could have formed from chemical and physical processes on early Earth. The next question is how the large molecules characteristic of life&#150;polymers such as polypeptides and polysaccharides&#150;formed without living cells or enzymes being present. In other experiments, scientists have taken solutions of amino acids and dripped them onto the surface of hot sand, clay, or rocks. Heat vaporizes the water in the solutions, leaving behind high concentrations of amino acids. Some of the concentrated amino acids then bond together and form polypeptides. Clay, in particular, concentrates amino acids and other organic monomers and could have held monomers close together. These experiments suggest that organic polymers such as polypeptides could have formed under the conditions found on early Earth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">"The RNA World"</span> A defining characteristic of life is the process of inheritance, which is based on molecules that can copy themselves. Cells in today's world transcribe genetic information from DNA into RNA, which then directs the synthesis of enzymes and other proteins. This mechanism of information flow could have emerged gradually through a series of changes.</p>

<p>Following this thinking, the next question is, what was the original process of copying hereditary information? One hypothesis is that the first genes were short strands of RNA that could replicate without the help of enzymes. In laboratory experiments, scientists have observed short RNA molecules copy themselves in solutions containing nucleotides (Figure 16-3). This copying took place without enzymes or cells being present. The early history of life may have included an "RNA world," a period when RNA served as both the molecule that stored genetic information and the molecule that directed protein synthesis.</p>

						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Formation of Pre-Cells</span> Solutions of organic compounds such as RNA and polypeptides were still far simpler than a living cell. Life today depends on complex organic molecules interacting in an organized and coordinated manner. How did this greater organization and coordination develop? Some biologists hypothesize that early organic molecules became organized into increased levels of order by becoming encased in a membrane.</p>

<p>This hypothesis, too, is testable. Experiments have shown that polypeptides can come together and form microscopic, fluid-filled spheres. If certain kinds of lipids are included in the solution, they form selectively permeable membranes similar to those of cells. Such molecular packages are called pre-cells (Figure 16-4). They are not living but do have some of the properties of living cells. It is important to keep in mind that even the simplest living organism is far more complex than any pre-cell produced in a laboratory so far.</p>

						</table></p>

<p>All of these experiments together support a hypothetical four-stage sequence for how life could have first developed on Earth. First, small organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides, formed from simpler molecules present in the environment. Second, these small molecules joined together into larger ones such as proteins and nucleic acids. Third, molecules that could copy themselves provided a basis for the inheritance of molecular information. In the last stage, these various organic molecules became packaged within membranes and separated from their surroundings. In other words, they formed pre-cells.</p>

<p>Laboratory simulations cannot prove that the chemical evolution described above actually led to life on primitive Earth. They only show that such events <i>could</i> have taken place. Debate abounds about the nature of each step and about missing steps that have not yet been tested by experiments. But such debates represent what science is all about: seeking possible explanations, developing hypotheses, and testing those hypotheses through experiments.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Where Did Life Begin?</span><br>
One of the questions that scientists also continue to debate is <i>where</i> life might have originated. Until recently, most researchers thought that the most likely sites for the origin of life were shallow water or moist sediments such as clay. But during Earth's early history, the land surface may have been too hot and too extreme for complex organic molecules or pre-cells to "survive" for long. The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents raised the possibility that similar environments might have supplied the energy and chemical raw materials for the origin of life. Today's deep-sea vents are populated with prokaryotic organisms that may resemble some of the earliest living cells.</p>
