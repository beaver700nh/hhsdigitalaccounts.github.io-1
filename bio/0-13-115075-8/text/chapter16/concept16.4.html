<p>You are constantly exposed to bacteria. They are in the air you breathe, in the water and food you ingest, and on the surfaces you touch. Though most bacteria are either harmless or helpful to you, some bacteria can make you ill.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Bacteria Cause Illness</span><br>
Bacteria and other microorganisms that cause disease are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpathoge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpathoge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pathogens</a>. Most people are usually healthy only because the body's defenses prevent the growth of pathogens. But occasionally, the balance shifts in favor of the pathogen and a person becomes ill. Even some of the bacteria that are normal residents of the body can make you sick when you are weakened by lack of sleep, poor nutrition, or another disease.</p>

<p>In Chapter 31 you will read about discoveries that helped scientists understand how pathogens are transmitted. For example, bacteria that cause anthrax and tuberculosis can be inhaled or transmitted by touching. Syphilis and gonorrhea are transmitted through sexual contact. Lyme disease is caused when the bite of a tick transfers the spirochete bacterium to the person bitten. Several organisms found on improperly stored or prepared foods cause food poisoning.</p>

<p>Some bacteria cause disease by invading tissues and destroying cells. The pathogen that causes tuberculosis is an example. This bacterium destroys the white blood cells that engulf them. Most pathogenic bacteria, however, cause disease by producing one of two types of bacterial poisons. One type consists of the poisonous proteins secreted by bacterial cells. <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> produces a highly toxic protein that causes botulism, a kind of food poisoning. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a common, usually harmless, resident of the skin surface. However, if the bacterium enters the body through a cut or is swallowed in food, the proteins it produces can cause serious illness.</p>

<p>The other type of poison is not a cell secretion but a component of the bacterial cell wall. These components can lead to fever, aches, and sometimes a dangerous drop in blood pressure (shock). The severity of symptoms varies with the host's health and with the species of bacterium. Different species of <i>Salmonella,</i> for example, produce cell wall components that cause food poisoning and typhoid fever.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Defense Against Bacterial Diseases</span><br>
Since the discovery that bacteria cause many diseases, cases of such diseases have declined dramatically. You might think that doctors and medicines are mainly responsible for this decline. However, the major reasons for this decline are better hygiene and public health measures. Behaviors such as washing hands, careful preparation of food, and attention to water quality help minimize the risk of pathogen infection. Because of the link between hygiene and disease prevention, many think that installing water treatment systems is a public health priority throughout the world.</p>

<p>Even when in contact with disease-causing bacteria, the human body protects itself against infection. Your skin and the mucous lining of your mouth, nose, and digestive system provide a physical barrier to bacteria. Those bacteria that do manage to enter (through a cut, for example) meet chemical and cellular defenses that make up the immune system. You will learn in more detail how this system functions in Chapter 31.</p>

<p>Of course, doctors and medicines do play a role in fighting bacterial diseases. One way is to use antibiotics, chemicals that slow or prevent the growth of microorganisms. Many antibiotics act by damaging or preventing the formation of the bacterial cell wall. These antibiotics can cripple many species of infectious bacteria without affecting human cells, which do not have cell walls. (Vaccines, which you will read about in Concept 16.5, are also effective in preventing some bacterial diseases.)</p>

<p>While antibiotics are important medicines, public health officials are concerned about their overuse. As you will soon read, these substances are ineffective against viral diseases, yet some people expect to be given antibiotics whenever they are ill. As described earlier, any mutation that enables a bacterium to resist an antibiotic is likely to spread rapidly in a bacterial population exposed to that antibiotic. Many bacteria strains exist now that can resist most current antibiotics.</p>
