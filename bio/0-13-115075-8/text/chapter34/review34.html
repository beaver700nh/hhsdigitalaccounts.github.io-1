 <b>b.</b> identifying the sources of food for an elephant population<br>
 <b>c.</b> observing the interactions between different fish inhabiting a coral reef<br>
 <b>d.</b> investigating how goats on a mountain compete for food</p>

 <b>b.</b> 30&deg; N and S latitude.<br>
 <b>c.</b> the equator.<br>
 <b>d.</b> the poles.</p>

 <b>a.</b> tundra.<br>
 <b>b.</b> desert.<br>
 <b>c.</b> mangrove swamp.<br>
 <b>d.</b> savanna.</p>

 <b>a.</b> temperate deciduous forest<br>
 <b>b.</b> chaparral<br>
 <b>c.</b> tropical rain forest<br>
 <b>d.</b> coniferous forest</p>

<p><b>6.</b> In a lake or the ocean, where would you be most likely to find phytoplankton?<br>
 <b>a.</b> in the photic zone<br>
 <b>b.</b> in the aphotic zone<br>
 <b>c.</b> in the benthic zone<br>
 <b>d.</b> in a hydrothermal vent</p>
 
<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>7.</b> List the five levels of ecological organization from smallest to largest. Which levels include abiotic as well as biotic factors?</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Define the term <i>habitat</i>. Give an example of an organism and its habitat.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Explain how wind might affect living things in an ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>10.</b>List Earth's three main temperature zones. In which zone do you live?</p>

<p><b>11.</b> How are surface currents in the ocean linked to climate patterns?</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Define the term <i>microclimate</i>. How might a microclimate create a microhabitat?</p>

<p><b>13.</b> What is permafrost? How does permafrost affect biotic factors in the tundra?</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Describe the different ecological zones in a large lake. What types of organisms live in each zone?</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>15.</b> Make and complete a table like the one shown below to compare and contrast the eight major terrestrial biomes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="34images/34-cr-15.gif" width="284" height="238" alt="biome table"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>16. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the diagram to answer the questions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="34images/34-cr-16.gif" width="290" height="239" alt="zones figure"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> Name the ocean zone labeled <i>A</i> in the diagram. Describe conditions in this zone.<br>
<b>b.</b> In which depth zone (<i>D</i> or <i>E</i>) do phytoplankton live? Explain why this is true.<br>
<b>c.</b> In which ocean zone (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, or <i>C</i>) would a hydrothermal vent ecosystem most likely be found? Describe conditions and a typical organism found in this ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>17. Analyzing Data</b> An ecologist has been collecting climate data from three locations: a desert, a tundra, and a temperate deciduous forest. After several years, the ecologist averaged the measurements to find a mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for each location. Based on the data below, suggest which set of data came from which location. Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="34images/34-cr-17.gif" width="300" height="168" alt="climate data table"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>18. Giving an Example</b> Identify three biotic factors and three abiotic factors in your classroom environment.</p>

<p><b>19. Relating Cause and Effect</b> Many of the world's largest deserts are located around 30&deg; N and 30&deg; S latitudes. Describe how global patterns of temperature, wind, and precipitation help explain this fact.</p>

<p><b>20. Relating Cause and Effect</b> What accounts for the great diversity of organisms in tropical rain forests?</p>

<p><b>21. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Describe at least two similarities and two differences between lake and ocean ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>22. Making Generalizations</b> Explain how abiotic factors help to shape biotic communities.</p>
		
<p><b>23. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Ecologists study Earth's living things.<br>
<b>b.</b> Deserts are hot, dry places.<br>
<b>c.</b> Nothing can grow in the harsh tundra climate.<br>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> Use an almanac or the Internet to find temperature and precipitation data for your city or state. What biome describes your area? Identify three other locations along the same longitude line, but at different latitudes. Predict how the climate in these areas compares to yours. Research their climate and make a visual aid of your findings. How do your results compare with your predictions? Suggest a reason for any differences.</p>
