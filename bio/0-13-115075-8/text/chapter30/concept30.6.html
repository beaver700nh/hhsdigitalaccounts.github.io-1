<p>In the United States, smoking contributes to over 400,000 deaths per year&#151;more than all the deaths caused by alcohol, cocaine, heroin, homicide, suicide, traffic accidents, fire, and AIDS combined. Why is smoking unhealthy? And why do many people find it hard to quit smoking?</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Smoking-Related Diseases</span><br>
Smoking a cigarette exposes the smoker to more than 4,000 different chemicals, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide. The toxic substances in tobacco smoke irritate the cells lining the bronchi and destroy the cilia. Without cilia, these cells lose the ability to move particles out of the respiratory system. Without the ability to remove these harmful particles from the lungs, smokers are at greater risk for diseases caused by these particles. In addition to the toxins from cigarette smoke, damage to the respiratory system also increases the risk of damage from air pollution, dust, and airborne bacteria.</p> 

<p>Compared with non-smokers, smokers also have an increased risk for developing cancers of the lung, bladder, pancreas, mouth, throat, and several other organs. For example, people who smoke tobacco products account for 90 percent of all lung cancer cases.</p>

<p>Another disease, <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gemphyse.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gemphyse.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">emphysema</a> (em fuh SEE muh), can develop when tobacco smoke causes the walls of the alveoli to lose their elasticity. This results in air becoming trapped inside the alveoli during exhalation. Breathing becomes more difficult, and the smoker becomes more easily tired. Other symptoms of emphysema can include shortness of breath and dramatic weight loss.</p>

<p>Smoking also increases a person's risk for some of the cardiovascular diseases you read about in Concept 30.4. Smokers have a higher rate of strokes and heart attacks. Part of the reason for this is that smoking can increase harmful cholesterol levels. In addition, the damage of smoking to the respiratory system requires the heart to work harder to deliver enough oxygen to the cells.</p>

<p>According to life insurance companies, someone who smokes a pack or more of cigarettes each day lives an average of seven years less than someone who has never smoked. Fortunately for smokers, after 10 years of not smoking, the chances of getting lung cancer and heart disease return to normal levels. But with all that is known about the negative consequences of smoking, why do so many people still do it? Part of the answer is related to the addictive nature of tobacco products.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Why Is Tobacco Addictive?</span><br>
Among the many dangerous chemicals in tobacco smoke, nicotine is the substance that makes tobacco addictive. Nicotine is easily absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. Inhaling cigarette smoke into the lungs increases the speed of absorption. High levels of nicotine can reach the brain within 10 seconds of inhaling. Once it reaches the brain, nicotine increases the level of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the part of the brain that controls pleasurable feelings. Dopamine causes the nerves to transmit signals more frequently, causing the person to experience pleasure.</p>

<p>However, the effects of nicotine disappear quickly. In order to maintain the high dopamine levels, the body craves more nicotine. A typical smoker takes 10 puffs on a single cigarette. A person who smokes a pack and a half (30 cigarettes) a day consumes 300 doses of nicotine each day.</p>

<p>Since all tobacco products contain nicotine, even users of smokeless tobacco, as well as pipe and cigar smokers, are absorbing nicotine and risking exposure to its addictive nature. Nearly 35 million people try to stop smoking every year. Unfortunately, less than 7 percent successfully stop smoking for more than one year. People who start smoking may not realize how hard it is to quit. The majority of adult smokers say they wish they had never started smoking.</p>
