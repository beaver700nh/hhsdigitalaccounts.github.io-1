<p>The size of a clenched fist, your heart beats an average of 70 times per minute&#151;over 100,000 times per day. This section explores the structure and function of this hard-working organ.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Two Circuits of Blood Flow</span><br>
Blood flows along two pathways, or circuits, in the body (Figure 30-5). The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpulmona.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpulmona.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pulmonary circuit</a> carries oxygen-depleted blood from the heart to the lungs and oxygen-rich blood back to the heart. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsystemi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsystemi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">systemic circuit</a> carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body and oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart. Blood flows through both circuits at the same time. While some blood is flowing in the pulmonary circuit, the rest is flowing through the systemic circuit. This double circuit ensures that oxygen-rich blood is constantly delivered to cells.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>In the pulmonary circuit, blood travels from the right side of the heart through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, which is exhaled. Pulmonary veins then return the oxygen-rich blood to the left side of the heart.</p>

<p>In the systemic circuit, oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart through the aorta, the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to all of the body. From the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaorta.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaorta.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">aorta</a>, oxygen-rich blood flows through the branching arteries to the capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen diffuses out of the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses in. The blood is now said to be oxygen-depleted. The oxygen-depleted blood returns to the right side of the heart through the veins.</p>

<p>Most arteries in the body carry oxygen-rich blood, while most veins carry oxygen-depleted blood. However, the vessels in the pulmonary circuit do the exact opposite. Pulmonary arteries carry oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs. Pulmonary veins carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Anatomy of the Heart</span><br>
The heart is a muscular pump located between your lungs. A sac called the pericardium encloses the heart. As in other mammals, the human heart has four chambers (Figure 30-6). The two upper chambers, which receive blood returning to the heart, are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gatrium.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gatrium.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">atria</a> (singular, <i>atrium</i>). The two lower chambers are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gventric.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gventric.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ventricles</a>, which pump blood out of the heart. The atria, which pump blood a short distance into the ventricles, have fairly thin walls. Ventricles have thicker muscular walls that enable them to pump blood throughout the body.</p>

<p>Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs gathers in the left atrium and is then pumped to the left ventricle. From there, blood is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body where it delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells. Oxygen-depleted blood returns to the right atrium via veins. Blood is then pumped into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs through pulmonary arteries. After being replenished with oxygen in the lungs, blood once again returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and gathers in the left atrium.</p>

<p>Flaps of tissue in the heart called <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvalve.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvalve.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">valves</a> prevent blood from flowing backward. Valves are located between the atria and ventricles (called atrioventricular valves), and also between the ventricles and the arteries leading from the heart (called the pulmonary valve and the aortic valve). With each heartbeat, the valves open, allowing blood to flow through. Then the valves close, preventing blood from flowing back. The familiar heart sound of "lub dupp" is caused by the valves snapping shut. The "lub" sound is the atrioventricular valves closing, while the "dupp" sound happens when the pulmonary and aortic valves close.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulation of the Heartbeat</span><br>
When you run up a flight of stairs or are startled by a sudden noise, your heart is likely to beat faster than it does when you are at rest. A specific region of your heart muscle, known as the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpacemak.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpacemak.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pacemaker</a>, sets the rate at which your heart contracts (Figure 30-7). The pacemaker is located in the wall of the right atrium. It generates electrical impulses that spread rapidly over the walls of both atria, making them contract. The impulses then spread to a region of the heart called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gavnode.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gavnode.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">AV node</a> (atrioventricular node). From there, the electrical impulses spread to the ventricles, causing them to contract. The contracting ventricles propel blood to the rest of the body.</p>

					<p align="center">
						<table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align=center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="30images/30-07.gif" width="525" height="277" ALT="Figure 30-7"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 30-7<br>The pacemaker sets the rate at which the heart contracts. Its signals generate electrical changes in the skin that can be measured as an electrocardiogram (ECG). The yellow color in the sample ECG below indicates the different stages of the heartbeat.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The pacemaker ensures that the heart beats in a rhythmic cycle. During the relaxation phase, called diastole, the atria and ventricles are relaxed, allowing blood from veins to enter the heart. The contraction phase is called systole. First the atria contract, and blood is forced into the ventricles, which are relaxed. Then the ventricles contract, pumping blood into arteries, while the atria are relaxed. This cycle repeats about every second when you are resting.</p>

<p>The pacemaker is controlled by both the nervous system and the endocrine system. Two sets of opposing nerves control the pacemaker by speeding it up and by slowing it down. Hormones secreted into the blood also control the pacemaker. For example, the hormone epinephrine, also called adrenaline, increases heart rate when the body is under stress.</p>

<p>Some diseases can disrupt the normal functioning of the pacemaker. One life-saving device is the cardiac defibrillator. When a patient's heart stops beating, paddle-like appliances are applied to the patient's chest, producing a strong electrical current that can cause the person's heart to resume beating.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Measuring Blood Pressure</span><br>
When the ventricles contract, they increase pressure on the blood. The resulting force that blood exerts against the artery walls is called blood pressure. This force drives blood through the arteries and into the capillaries. Artery walls are elastic, which enables them to stretch in response to this force.</p>

<p>Blood pressure is represented by two numbers separated by a slash, such as 120/70 (Figure 30-8). It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), a standard unit of liquid pressure. The first number is referred to as <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsystoli.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsystoli.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">systolic pressure</a>, the highest recorded pressure in an artery when the ventricles contract (systole). <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdiastol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdiastol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Diastolic pressure</a>, the second number, is the lowest recorded pressure in an artery during the relaxation phase of the heartbeat (diastole).</p>

<p>A blood pressure of about 120/70 is the average for a healthy young adult. As a person ages, blood pressure may increase. Smoking or a fatty diet can contribute to this increase by causing arteries to become less elastic. A blood pressure above 140/90 is considered high and may lead to other cardiovascular diseases.</p>
