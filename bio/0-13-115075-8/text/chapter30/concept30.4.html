<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of people, young and old, die from heart attacks and strokes. Some of these people were unaware of their disease before the fatal attack. Fortunately you can reduce the risk of heart disease by proper diet and exercise throughout your life.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Types of Cardiovascular Disease</span><br>
If you could peer into the arteries of a newborn baby, you would probably see fairly smooth blood vessels. If you could inspect the arteries of an older person, however, you might find a patchwork of cholesterol, calcium, and fat deposits, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplaque.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplaque.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plaque</a> (plak), adhering to the interior walls. Plaque builds up throughout a person's life. While a teenager may not feel any symptoms of the disease, significant buildup of plaque can ultimately lead to <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcardiov.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcardiov.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cardiovascular disease</a>, illness of the heart and/or blood vessels.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Atherosclerosis</span> Narrowing of the arteries, a condition called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gatheros.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gatheros.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">atherosclerosis</a> (ath ur oh skluh ROH sis), results from plaque building up inside the artery wall. As the pathway narrows, blood pressure increases. Sometimes the narrowing completely blocks the flow of blood. If such a blockage occurs in one of the coronary arteries, the main arteries that supply the heart, the heart becomes deprived of oxygen and other nutrients. In mild cases with partial blockage, the person may feel occasional chest pains, called angina pectoris. In cases of severe blockage, a blood clot could close up the artery, leading to a <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/gheartat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/gheartat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">heart attack</a>.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Arteriosclerosis</span> A more advanced stage of plaque buildup, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/garterio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/garterio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">arteriosclerosis</a> (ar tir ee oh skluh ROH sis), occurs when the deposits on the artery wall harden. As you read in Concept 30.1, arteries are flexible and can expand and contract, which helps to control blood pressure. With arteriosclerosis, the arteries lose their ability to stretch. This disease increases blood pressure and the chance for blood clots to form within the blood vessels.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Hypertension</span> Anger or fear can temporarily raise a person's blood pressure. However, if a person has a blood pressure of 140/90 or higher for an extended period of time, that person is said to have <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghyperte.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghyperte.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hypertension</a>, or high blood pressure. Prolonged hypertension damages the heart and blood vessels. The heart must work harder to pump blood throughout the body, and over time the heart muscles enlarge. If these muscles expand too much, they actually become weakened and incapable of pushing blood throughout the body. Hypertension also exerts greater than normal pressure on the walls of the arteries, which can cause small tears. These tears can speed up atherosclerosis, which further increases blood pressure.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Stroke</span> You have already read that a blood clot that forms in a coronary artery can cause a heart attack. If a blood clot forms in an artery going to the brain, it can cause a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstroke.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstroke.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stroke</a>, damage to brain tissue resulting from blocked blood flow. Tissue downstream from the blockage dies from lack of oxygen. Some consequences of stroke are partial paralysis, loss of speech, memory loss, and sometimes death. These effects depend in part on where in the brain the blockage occurred.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Preventive Actions You Can Take Now</span><br>
Although some risk for cardiovascular disease is genetic, there are also many controllable factors that play a role. For example, smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diets all increase risk. You can lessen your risk of future cardiovascular disease by making certain choices throughout your life. For example, you can limit your intake of cholesterol. Cholesterol is one ingredient in the plaque that coats artery walls. Cholesterol is found in foods containing saturated animal fats, such as butter and meat. High cholesterol levels increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Other preventive measures you can take include limiting your intake of salt (high salt levels can increase blood pressure) and eating lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods. Some researchers think that the fiber in these types of food helps to lower cholesterol levels. The proper diet, combined with regular exercise to maintain cardiovascular fitness, will help keep your circulatory system healthy.</p>
