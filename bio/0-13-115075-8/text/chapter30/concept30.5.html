<p>If you were stranded on a desert island or left adrift in a lifeboat, you would be able to survive for days without fresh water and for weeks without food. But if you were stranded on the moon, where there is no oxygen, you would perish within minutes. In this section, you will read about the importance of respiration to your everyday survival.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Anatomy of the Respiratory System</span><br>
You read earlier in this chapter that all organisms must exchange materials with their environment. All your cells require oxygen to obtain energy efficiently from organic molecules during cellular respiration. However, most of your cells can't obtain oxygen directly from the environment. The function of the respiratory system is to provide oxygen for distribution to cells throughout your body. The respiratory system also removes the waste product carbon dioxide from the body.</p>

<p>The structures of the respiratory system include the mouth, nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and lungs (Figure 30-14). As you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through the nose or mouth. Many of the impurities in air, such as dirt and bacteria, are filtered by hair and mucus in the nose. As air enters the body through the nose or mouth, it is warmed and moisture is added. Next, air passes into the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpharynx.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpharynx.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pharynx</a> (the throat), where the passageways for air and food cross. The air pathway in the pharynx is always open, except when you swallow. Then a flap of tissue called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gepiglot.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gepiglot.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">epiglottis</a> momentarily covers the air pathway and prevents water or food from entering.</p>

<p>From the pharynx, air passes through the voice box or <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glarynx.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glarynx.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">larynx</a>. (Vocal cords in the larynx vibrate as you exhale, producing sounds.) Air next passes into the <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtrachea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">trachea</a> (TRAY kee uh), or windpipe. The tubular shape of the trachea is maintained by c-shaped rings of cartilage. The trachea forks into two <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbronchu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbronchu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bronchi</a> (BRAHNG ki; singular, <i>bronchus</i>), air tubes that connect the trachea to the lungs. You have two <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glung.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glung.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lungs</a> consisting of sponge-like tissue, each about the size of a football, that function in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood.</p>

<p>Within each lung, the bronchus branches repeatedly into finer and finer tubes called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbronchi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbronchi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bronchioles</a>. This branching pattern looks somewhat like an upside-down tree, and in fact the system of tubes is sometimes called "the respiratory tree." Each bronchiole ends in grapelike clusters of tiny air sacs called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/galveolu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/galveolu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">alveoli</a> (singular, <i>alveolus</i>) (Figure 30-15). The lungs contain millions of these tiny air sacs. The inner surface of each alveolus is lined with a layer of moist epithelial cells. Oxygen in the air you inhale dissolves in the film of moisture on these epithelial cells. Oxygen then diffuses into a web of capillaries surrounding each alveolus and enters red blood cells, binding to hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide diffuses the opposite way, from the capillaries across the epithelial cells and into the alveoli. Then the carbon dioxide is expelled back up the trachea, through the nose or mouth, and into the air.</p>

<p>The respiratory system, from the nose and mouth all the way to the lungs, is lined with moist epithelial tissue. In the trachea, bronchi, and the epithelial cells are covered with cilia and a fine layer of mucus, which act like cleaning elements. The mucus traps foreign particles. The cilia then sweep the mucus-trapped particles up toward the pharynx where they can be swallowed.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Breathing</span><br>
The process of moving air into and out of your lungs is called breathing. Although you were most likely unaware of it, you probably took a breath of air and released it while you were reading this sentence. On average, you breathe about 15 times per minute, or more than 21,000 breaths each day.</p>

<p>A sheet of muscle called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdiaphra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdiaphra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">diaphragm</a>, which forms the bottom wall of the chest cavity, plays a key role in breathing (Figure 30-16). You inhale when your diaphragm and rib muscles contract, which expands your chest cavity. This action increases the volume of your lungs, resulting in reduced air pressure within the alveoli. Since air tends to move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, air rushes in through the nose or mouth and fills the alveoli.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>
				
<p>You exhale when your diaphragm and rib muscles relax. This decreases your lung volume, causing higher air pressure in the alveoli. Air rushes from your lungs out through your nose or mouth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulation of Breathing</span><br>
You might think that the rate of breathing is controlled by the level of oxygen in the body. But, surprisingly, it is usually the level of carbon dioxide that controls breathing rate (Figure 30-17). As carbon dioxide diffuses through a capillary wall, most of it dissolves in the plasma, the liquid portion of blood. When carbon dioxide dissolves in a solution containing water, it forms carbonic acid (H<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>CO<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span>). If, for example, you exercise heavily, cell metabolism increases carbon dioxide output. This causes more carbon dioxide to dissolve in the blood. The increased carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood slightly lowers its pH. A drop in pH level causes the brain to send nerve impulses that increase breathing rate. As a result, more carbon dioxide is exhaled, and the pH returns to normal.

<p>Breathing is usually an involuntary process that you seldom realize is occurring. Most of the time, breathing is controlled by the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain located near the top of the spinal cord. The medulla oblongata sends nerve signals to the diaphragm and rib muscles, causing them to contract and relax. However, you can temporarily exert conscious control over breathing, such as when you hold your breath under water.</p>
