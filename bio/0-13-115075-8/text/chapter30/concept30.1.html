<p>Your circulatory system includes a network of about 100,000 kilometers of blood vessels. Laid end to end, they would encircle Earth two and a half times! This network of vessels supplies the trillion cells in your body with nutrients and oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide and other waste products.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Organs of the Circulatory System</span><br>
As you read in Chapter 7, your cells require a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen. If diffusion were the only method of transportation, it could take as long as two years for these chemicals to travel from your small intestine to the cells in your brain. Fortunately, your body has a more efficient distribution system&#151;the circulatory system.</p>

<p>In addition to delivering nutrients and oxygen to cells, the circulatory system transports hormones throughout your body and carries wastes away from cells. The circulatory system also plays important roles in repairing tissue and protecting the body from infection, as you will read in Chapter 31.</p>

<p>The three primary components of the circulatory system are the blood, the heart, and the blood vessels (Figure 30-1). <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gblood.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gblood.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Blood</a> is a type of connective tissue made up of cells and liquid. Blood is pumped through the body by the <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/gheart.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/gheart.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">heart</a>, a multi-chambered, muscular organ. The overall flow of blood is from the heart to tissues throughout the body and back to the heart.</p>

<p>Blood flows throughout your body via blood vessels, tubes that form a closed pipeline within the body. Your body contains about 5 liters of blood. Under normal activity, it takes about one minute for all that blood to make a complete circuit through the body. Increased activity, such as running or dancing, causes your blood to circulate more quickly, keeping your cells supplied with oxygen and nutrients. There are three types of blood vessels that make up this pathway: capillaries, arteries, and veins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Capillaries</span> To distribute nutrients and oxygen effectively, the circulatory system must have close contact with all the cells of the body. This close contact is accomplished by millions of microscopic blood vessels called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcapilla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcapilla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">capillaries</a> (Figure 30-2). Some capillaries are so narrow that blood cells must travel through them one at a time. The walls of capillaries consist of a very thin layer of epithelial tissue encased in a moist membrane. This structure enables the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen out of the blood and the diffusion of waste products into the blood.</p>

						</table></p>
						
<p><span class="setextsubsm">Arteries</span> Blood flows from the heart to the capillaries through a system of thick-walled blood vessels called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gartery.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gartery.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">arteries</a>. The walls of arteries consist of epithelial tissue wrapped in layers of smooth muscle and connective tissue. The muscle tissue enables the artery to constrict (become more narrow) and to dilate (relax). The blood in arteries is under pressure due to the heart's pumping action. This pressure helps to ensure that blood flows only in one direction&#151;toward the capillaries. Further from the heart, the arteries branch into smaller and smaller vessels. Eventually the narrowest arteries flow into capillaries.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Veins</span> Blood returns from the capillaries to the heart through vessels called <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvein.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvein.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">veins</a>. The walls of veins also consist of epithelial tissue surrounded by smooth muscle and connective tissue. But the muscle layer in veins is thinner than that in arteries. The blood in veins is under very little pressure. The main force that pushes blood through the veins comes from the skeletal muscle tissue in which many veins are located. Contracting these muscles squeezes the veins and forces blood through them. Most veins contain valves that allow blood to flow only toward the heart. Small veins merge together into larger veins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Chemical Exchange Between Blood and Body Tissues</span><br>
As you have read, capillaries are in close contact with the cells of your body. In fact, most cells in your body are no farther than 10 micrometers (&#181;m) from a capillary and the blood inside it. This capillary network and the structure of the individual capillaries are critical to accomplishing the main functions of the circulatory system&#151;the distribution of oxygen and nutrients, and the removal of waste products.</p>

<p>As you read in Chapter 27, cells in body tissues are surrounded by interstitial fluid. Thus the substances in capillaries do not enter tissue cells directly. First these substances must enter the interstitial fluid, then enter the cells. The exchange of substances between blood and the interstitial fluid occurs in several ways. Some small molecules, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, diffuse across membranes or pass through gaps between the epithelial cells of the capillary wall. Oxygen and nutrients move from the blood into the interstitial fluid, while carbon dioxide and other small waste products move from the interstitial fluid into the blood. Larger molecules move across the membranes by exocytosis and endocytosis. (See Chapter 6 to review these transport processes.)</p> 

<p>Blood pressure also forces fluid through the capillary wall. At the artery end of a capillary, blood pressure forces water, small solutes, and some dissolved proteins through the gaps between cells (Figure 30-3). However, blood cells and larger proteins are too large to pass easily through these openings, so they remain in the capillary. As a result, the vein end of the capillary is hypertonic compared to the surrounding interstitial fluid.  (Recall that a hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration than another solution.) Thus water tends to reenter the vein end of the capillary via osmosis. Blood pressure is very low at the vein end of the capillary, so it does not oppose the flow of fluid back into the capillary. In fact, 85 percent of the fluid that leaves the artery end of the capillary reenters at the vein end.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Lymphatic System</span><br>
Your blood loses about 4 liters of fluid into the interstitial fluid each day. The lymphatic system collects and returns most of this fluid to the circulatory system. Like the circulatory system, the lymphatic system consists of capillaries and larger vessels (Figure 30-4). Once inside the lymphatic vessels, this collected fluid is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glymph.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glymph.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lymph</a>. Like veins, lymphatic vessels are embedded in muscle tissue. Also like veins, lymphatic vessels have valves that prevent lymph from flowing back toward the capillaries. The combination of muscle contractions squeezing the vessels and the one-way valves helps fluid move through the lymphatic system. Eventually, lymph drains into the circulatory system near the heart, allowing the fluid to be reused.</p>

<p>Located at juncture points throughout the lymphatic system are enlargements in the lymph tissue called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes help defend the body against infection. The nodes contain cells that destroy some bacteria and viruses that may enter the body. Have you ever had "swollen lymph glands" in your neck when you've had a cold or the flu? These "glands" are actually groupings of lymph nodes, swollen with infection-fighting cells. In Chapter 31 you will read more about the lymphatic system's role in fighting disease.</p>
