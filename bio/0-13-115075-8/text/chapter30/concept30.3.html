<p>Part liquid, part cellular material, your blood is a highly specialized tissue. It is also the only tissue you can donate to others as often as every other month, once you reach 17 years of age (according to the American Red Cross).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Make-up of Blood</span><br>
Your blood has several functions that are essential to your good health. As you have been reading, blood is responsible for transporting oxygen, water, and nutrients to cells. It also distributes hormones throughout the body. Blood removes waste products from the tissues and delivers them to the organs of the excretory system. In addition to its transport functions, blood also helps to fight infection and heal wounds.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Plasma</span> Blood is the only liquid connective tissue in your body (Figure 30-9). Fifty-five percent of the volume of blood is a solution called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplasma.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplasma.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasma</a>. Plasma is 90 percent water. The other 10 percent of plasma consists of dissolved salts, proteins, and other transported substances. The remaining 45 percent of blood volume consists mostly of red blood cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Red Blood Cells</span> By far the most numerous cells in your blood are red blood cells, or erythrocytes. <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gredbloo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gredbloo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Red blood cells</a> carry oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues of the body. One drop of blood (1 cubic millimeter) contains about 5 million red blood cells, and the average person has about 25 trillion in all. Each red blood cell contains about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin, a protein that temporarily stores oxygen for delivery to the cells. <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghemoglo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghemoglo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Hemoglobin</a> is a good transporter of oxygen because it contains iron. Oxygen molecules bind to the iron portion (also called the heme group) of the hemoglobin molecule.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow at the rate of 2 million per second in a healthy adult. As red blood cells mature, they lose their nuclei and mitochondria. The loss of these structures helps give red blood cells their distinctive shape, like a flat disk that curves inward in the middle on both the top and bottom. This structure provides increased surface area for oxygen transfer compared to a spherical shape with the same volume.</p>

<p>Since a mature red blood cell has no nucleus, it cannot replace proteins, grow, or divide. The typical lifespan of a red blood cell is between 100 and 120 days. As red blood cells age, they become fragile and are eventually broken down.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">White Blood Cells</span>  Also called leukocytes, <a href="../../glossary/terms/w/gwhitebl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/w/gwhitebl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">white blood cells</a> have nuclei and mitochondria and are responsible for fighting infection and preventing the growth of cancer. Normally, there are between 4,000 and 11,000 white blood cells in a drop (one cubic millimeter) of blood. However, when infection invades your body, the number of white blood cells increases. Most of the action of white blood cells takes place outside the blood vessels in the interstitial fluid. You will read more about white blood cells in Chapter 31.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Blood Clotting</span><br>
When you get a small cut or scrape, your blood usually clots, stopping the bleeding and sealing the wound. The clotting process depends on small fragments of blood cells called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplatele.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplatele.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">platelets</a> that originate in the bone marrow. Each drop of blood contains between 250,000 and 500,000 platelets.</p> 

<p>The blood clotting process begins when platelets adhere to the site where the blood vessel is damaged. The platelets break apart and release substances called clotting factors. The clotting factors make other nearby platelets sticky and activate a series of reactions among other clotting factors in the plasma. These reactions result in the formation of a protein called fibrin. Fibrin threads trap red blood cells and additional platelets. This network of threads and cells builds up, eventually forming a patch that stretches over the torn tissue. This patch dries into a scab.</p>
