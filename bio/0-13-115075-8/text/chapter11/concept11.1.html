<p>Scientists identified DNA as a chemical in the nucleus of cells more than 100 years ago. Even so, Mendel, Morgan, and other early geneticists did all their work without any knowledge of how DNA played a role in heredity. How biologists learned that DNA is the genetic material is one of the great stories of science. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Griffith's "Transforming Factor" Is the Genetic Material</span><br>
The story opens in 1928. British biologist Frederick Griffith was studying two forms, or strains, of a bacterial species: one strain caused a kind of pneumonia fatal to mice, while the other strain was harmless. Figure 11-1 shows each step in Griffith's experiments. When he injected heat-treated bacteria into mice, the mice remained healthy. Heat kills the deadly strain of the bacterium, making it harmless.</p>

He called this the "transforming factor."</span></td>

						</table></p>

<p>Griffith's important discovery came when he injected mice with a mixture of the harmless strain and the heat-treated deadly strain. Since neither of these treatments on its own could kill the mice, he expected the mice to survive. However, the mixture killed the mice. Some of the harmless bacteria had been "transformed," becoming deadly. Furthermore, Griffith discovered that all of the descendants of the transformed bacteria inherited the killer trait. Clearly, some substance in the deadly strain remained active despite the heat treatment. This substance caused a heritable change in the other strain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Avery Shows DNA Is the Transforming Factor </span><br>
Other scientists began to search for this "transforming factor." Attention focused on two types of chemicals: protein and DNA. These chemicals were the most likely candidates because scientists already knew that chromosomes, which function in inheritance, consist of protein and DNA. In 1944, American biologist Oswald Avery and his colleagues took Griffith's experiments one step further. To test whether protein was the transforming factor, they treated Griffith's mixture of heat-treated deadly strain and live harmless strain with protein-destroying enzymes. The bacterial colonies grown from the mixture were still transformed. Avery and his colleagues concluded that protein could not be the transforming factor. Next, they treated the mixture with DNA-destroying enzymes. This time the colonies failed to transform. Avery concluded that DNA is the genetic material of the cell. As the experiments of Griffith and Avery illustrate, science is a process in which discoveries often build upon the results of previous experiments.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Virus Experiments Provide More Evidence</span><br>
Despite Avery's findings, many scientists remained skeptical that genes were made of DNA rather than protein. Proteins are made of 20 different amino acid building blocks. DNA, on the other hand, has only four nucleotide building blocks. Many people thought DNA seemed too simple to account for the large variety of traits inherited by organisms. Which one, DNA or protein, was truly the hereditary material? In 1952, biologists Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase provided more evidence to distinguish between these two possibilities. They conducted a series of experiments using viruses.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvirus.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvirus.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">virus</a> is a package of nucleic acid wrapped in a protein coat. Unlike living things, viruses are not made of cells. Also, a virus can only reproduce by infecting a living cell with its genetic material. The viral genetic material then directs the cell's machinery to make more viruses. A virus that infects bacteria is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbactpha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbactpha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">bacteriophage</a> (bak TEER ee oh fayj), or phage for short. You'll read more about viruses in Chapter 16.</p>

<p>Hershey and Chase knew that the particular phage they worked with has two basic components: DNA on the inside, coated with protein on the outside. One of these components must be the hereditary material, but which one? They devised an experiment to determine which part of the phage, the DNA or the protein, enters a bacterium and directs it to make more phages. For one batch of infecting phages, they used a radioactive isotope of sulfur to label only the phages' protein coats. (Sulfur is an element found in proteins but not in DNA.) In another batch of phages, they used a radioactive isotope of phosphorus to label only DNA. (Phosphorus is an element found in DNA but not in proteins.)</p>

<p>Next, they allowed each batch of phages to infect separate cultures of nonradioactive bacterial cells. They then whirled each culture in a blender to shake loose any parts of the phages that remained outside the bacterial cells. They measured radioactivity in the loose phage parts and in the bacterial cells. </p>

<p>When only phage protein coats were labeled, most of the radioactivity was detected outside the cells (Figure 11-4). But when phage DNA was labeled, most of the radioactivity was detected inside the cells.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Hershey and Chase concluded that the phage's DNA entered the bacterial cell during infection, but the proteins did not. They further concluded that DNA must carry the genetic information responsible for producing new phages. Their results convinced the scientific world that DNA was the hereditary material.</p>
