<p>Sickle cell disease is an example of a disorder caused by a genetic mutation. In sickle cell disease, the hemoglobin in red blood cells tends to bind together when oxygen levels are low. The hemoglobin crystals deform the red blood cells into sickle, or crescent, shapes. The sickle-shaped cells clog tiny blood vessels, dangerously blocking the normal flow of blood. The molecular basis for the disease lies in the difference of only one DNA nucleotide out of a 438-base sequence.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Mutations Affect Genes</span><br>
A <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmutatio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmutatio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">mutation</a> is any change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Mutations can involve large regions of a chromosome or just a single nucleotide pair, as in the sickle cell allele described above. How can small changes such as altering a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence cause such big changes in the phenotype?</p>

<p>Mutations within a gene can be divided into two general categories: base substitutions and base insertions or deletions. A base substitution is the replacement of one base or nucleotide with another (Figure 11-20a). Occasionally, a base substitution causes no change to a protein, but sometimes it results in a change that affects the function of a protein, sometimes drastically (as in the base substitution leading to sickle cell disease).
How can some base substitutions show no effect on the protein that is made? Remember that in the genetic code, several amino acids have more than one codon. For example, both GAA and GAG code for the same amino acid (Glu). If a mutation to DNA causes the mRNA codon to change from GAA to GAG, no change in the protein product would result. This kind of mutation is called a "silent mutation." Other changes of a single nucleotide may result in an mRNA that codes for an amino acid whose chemical properties are similar enough to the original amino acid that there is little effect on the overall function of the protein.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in a gene is usually more disastrous than the effects of a base substitution. Because mRNA is read as a series of triplets, adding or subtracting nucleotides may alter the triplet groupings of the genetic message. Therefore, all the nucleotides that are "downstream" of the mutation will be regrouped into different codons (Figure 11-20b). These new codons code for new amino acids. The result will be a different, and probably nonworking, protein.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">What Causes Mutations?</span><br>
Mutations may occur when errors are made during DNA replication, or when errors are made during chromosome crossovers in meiosis. Physical or chemical agents that cause mutations are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmutagen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmutagen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">mutagens</a> (MYOOT uh junz). The most common physical mutagen is high-energy radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet light. One type of chemical mutagen consists of chemicals that are similar to normal DNA bases but cause incorrect base-pairing when incorporated into DNA.</p>

<p>Although mutations are often harmful, they can alter a protein in a way that may be beneficial in certain environments. For example, a genetic mutation is responsible for the dark color seen in some females of the tiger swallowtail butterfly species, <i>Papilio glaucus.</i> The mutation may be advantageous when the environment includes a related species, the poisonous black swallowtail <i>Battus philenor</i>. Predators that avoid eating the black swallowtail may also avoid eating its mimic, the dark form of <i>P. glaucus.</i></p>


<p>If a mutation is present in an organism's gametes, it can be passed on to its offspring. Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic diversity in the living world&#151;a topic you will explore in the next several chapters.</p>
