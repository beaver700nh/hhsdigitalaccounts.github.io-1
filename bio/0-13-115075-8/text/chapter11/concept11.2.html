<p>Once most biologists were convinced that DNA is the genetic material, new questions arose. What is it about the specific arrangement of atoms that gives DNA its unique properties? How is DNA able to store genetic information, copy it, and pass it from generation to generation? The challenge became one of determining how the structure of this molecule could account for its role in heredity.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Building Blocks of DNA</span><br>
The heritable genetic information of an organism is stored in the molecule called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdeoxyri.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdeoxyri.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA). DNA is a kind of nucleic acid, a polymer built from monomers called nucleotides. Another group of nucleic acids, called ribonucleic acids (RNAs), also plays a key role in cells. You will learn about the function of RNAs later in this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Nitrogenous Bases</span>
The four nucleotides found in DNA differ only in their nitrogenous bases, called bases for short (Figure 11-6). The bases thymine (T) and cytosine (C) are single-ring structures called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpyrimid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpyrimid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pyrimidines</a> (py RIM uh deenz). Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are larger, double-ring structures called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpurine.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpurine.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">purines</a> (PYOOR eenz). The one-letter abbreviations stand for both the bases alone and for the nucleotides containing them.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">DNA Strands</span>
Nucleotides are joined to one another by covalent bonds that connect the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of the next. This repeating pattern of sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate is called a sugar-phosphate "backbone." The nitrogenous bases are lined up along this backbone (Figure 11-7).</p>

<p>Just as amino acid monomers combine and form a polypeptide, the nucleotides of a nucleic acid polymer can combine in many different sequences. For example, the part of a nucleic acid shown in Figure 11-7 has nine nucleotides arranged in the order CTGCTATCG. This arrangement is only one of many possible. Since nucleotide chains also vary in length, from only a few hundred nucleotides to millions of nucleotides, the number of possible nucleotide sequences is essentially unlimited.</p>

<p>For years, people wondered how strings of nucleotides could serve as the hereditary material. As you will read next, it turns out that a string of nucleotides is just one key feature of DNA's structure.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">DNA's Structure</span><br>
In the early 1950s, scientists Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins produced some intriguing photographs of DNA using a method called X-ray crystallography. This technique provides clues to the shapes and dimensions of complex molecules. The photographs showed the basic shape of DNA to be a helix, and revealed the basic dimensions of the helix.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Double Helix</span> Meanwhile, scientists James Watson and Francis Crick modeled DNA's structure with tin and wire. Their early models failed to explain DNA's chemical properties. Then one day, Watson saw one of Franklin's X-ray crystallography photos of DNA. Using the clues provided by Franklin's work, Watson and Crick created a new model in which two strands of nucleotides wound about each other. This formed a twisting shape called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdoubleh.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdoubleh.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">double helix</a> (Figure 11-8). Their model placed the sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside of the double helix and the nitrogenous bases on the inside. They hypothesized that the nitrogenous bases that aligned across the two strands formed hydrogen bonds. This new model successfully represented DNA's structure.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="350" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center" valign="top"><img src="11images/11-08.gif" width="125" height="284" ALT="Figure 11-8"></td>
									<td align="left" valign="bottom"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 11-8<br>The bases pair up between the two intertwined sugar-phosphate backbones, forming the double helix discovered by Watson and Crick. A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.</span></td>
								</tr>
					</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Complementary Base Pairs</span> Watson and Crick realized that the individual structures of the nitrogenous bases determine very specific pairings between the nucleotides of the two strands of the double helix. These pairings are due to the sizes of the bases and their abilities to form hydrogen bonds with each other. The purine adenine pairs with the pyrimidine thymine, and the purine guanine pairs with the pyrimidine cytosine. In the biologist's shorthand, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. A is also said to be "complementary" to T, and G is complementary to C. So, while the <i>sequence</i> of nucleotides along the length of one of the two DNA strands can vary in countless ways, the bases on the second strand of the double helix are determined by the sequence of the bases on the first strand. Each base must pair up with its complementary base. Base-pairing rules set the stage for understanding how the information in DNA is passed through generations, as you will learn in Concept 11.3.</p>	

<p>In 1953, Watson and Crick described their model in a two-page article in the science journal <i>Nature</i>. Few milestones in the history of biology have been as important as the discovery of the double helix and the pairing of complementary bases.</p>
