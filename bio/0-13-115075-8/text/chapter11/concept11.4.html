<p>When you were younger, did you ever use codes to send secret messages to your friends? Your first codes might have had simple rules such as using the alphabet backwards or using numbers to represent letters. Perhaps you developed codes with even more complex rules. Code-breaking can be an interesting challenge. Just think of the challenges scientists faced in breaking the genetic code.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">One Gene, One Polypeptide</span><br>
With the structure of DNA in mind, you can now put into molecular terms the concepts of genotype and phenotype you learned about in Chapter 10. An organism's <i>genotype</i>, its genetic makeup, is the sequence of nucleotide bases in its DNA. The molecular basis of the <i>phenotype,</i> the organism's specific traits, lies in proteins and their wide variety of functions. What is the connection between the DNA that defines the genotype and the proteins that, along with environmental influences, determine the phenotype? </p>

<p>The major breakthrough in demonstrating the relationship between genes and proteins came in the 1940s. American geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum worked with the orange bread mold <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. Beadle and Tatum studied mutant strains of the mold that were unable to grow on the usual nutrient medium. Each of these mutant strains turned out to lack a single enzyme needed to produce some molecule the mold needed, such as a vitamin or an amino acid. Beadle and Tatum also showed that each mutant was defective in a single gene. Their research led them to propose the "one gene&#150;one enzyme" hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the function of an individual gene is to dictate the production of a specific enzyme.</p>

<p>Since then, scientists have learned that some genes actually dictate the production of a single <i>polypeptide,</i> which may make up part of an enzyme or another kind of protein. Beadle and Tatum's hypothesis is now generally stated as one gene&#150;one <i>polypeptide.</i></p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Information Flow: DNA to RNA to Protein</span><br>
The language of genes is written as a sequence of bases along the length of a DNA chain. If the bases are the language's letters, each gene is like a sentence. Specific strings of bases make up each gene "sentence" on one DNA strand.</p>

<p>What is the connection between these genes and the polypeptides in a cell? The answer involves RNA, another kind of nucleic acid with a structure similar to that of DNA. <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gribonuc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gribonuc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">RNA (ribonucleic acid)</a> is any nucleic acid whose sugar is ribose rather than the deoxyribose of DNA. Another difference between RNA and DNA is that RNA contains a nitrogenous base called uracil (U) instead of the thymine of DNA. Uracil is very similar to thymine, and pairs with adenine. The other components of RNA are the same as those for DNA. RNA typically forms a single, sometimes twisted strand, not a double helix like DNA.</p>

<p>Several RNA molecules play a part in the intermediate steps from gene to protein. In the first step, DNA's nucleotide sequence is converted to the form of a single-stranded RNA molecule in a process called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtranscr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtranscr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">transcription</a> (Figure 11-12). This "transcribed" message leaves the nucleus and directs the making of proteins in the cytoplasm, while the DNA remains in the nucleus.</p>

<p>When a reporter transcribes a speech, the language remains the same. However, the form of the message changes from spoken language to written language. Similarly, when DNA is transcribed, the result is RNA&#151;a different form of the same message. The next step, however, does require changing languages. Much as English can be translated into Russian, genetic <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtransla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtransla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">translation</a> converts nucleic acid language into amino acid language. The flow of information from gene to protein is based on codons. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcodon.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcodon.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">codon</a> is a three-base "word" that codes for one amino acid. Several codons form a "sentence" that translates into a polypeptide. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Triplet Code</span><br>
What are the rules for translating the nucleotide sequence of RNA into an amino acid sequence? In other words, which codons are translated into which amino acids? American biochemist Marshall Nirenberg began cracking this code in the early 1960s. He built an RNA molecule that only had uracil nucleotides, called "poly U." (Recall that RNA has U instead of T.) Because it contained only uracil nucleotides, it contained only one type of codon: UUU, repeated over and over. Nirenberg added poly U to a test-tube mixture containing all 20 amino acids, plus the enzymes and other chemicals required for building polypeptides. The result was translation of the poly U into a polypeptide consisting entirely of a single kind of amino acid: phenylalanine. Nirenberg concluded that the RNA codon UUU codes for the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe).</p>

<p>Using similar methods, Nirenberg and others determined the amino acids represented by each codon. As Figure 11-13 shows, 61 of the 64 triplets code for amino acids. Notice that some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon, but no codon represents more than one amino acid. For example, codons UUU and UUC both specify phenylalanine, and neither of them ever codes for any other amino acid. The three codons that do not code for amino acids are "stop codons" that come at the end of each gene sequence.</p>

The codon AUG not only stands for methionine (Met), but also functions as a signal to "start" translating an RNA transcript. There are also three "stop" codons that do not code for amino acids, but signal the end of each genetic message.</span></td>

<p>This same genetic coding system is shared by  almost all organisms. In experiments, genes can be transcribed and translated after being transferred from one species to another, even when the species are as different as a human and a bacterium! The universal nature of the genetic code suggests that it arose very early in the history of life and has been passed on over time to all the organisms living on Earth today.</p>
