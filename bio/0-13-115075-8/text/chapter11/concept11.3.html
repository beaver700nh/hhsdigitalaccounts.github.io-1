<p>Have you ever had additional copies of a favorite photo made from a photo negative? Even if you've lost your negative, a new negative can be made from your print, from which more prints can be made. In this section, you'll read how this same principle enables a cell to make a copy of its genetic material.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Template Mechanism</span><br>
When a cell divides, forming new cells, a complete set of genetic instructions is generated for each new cell. And when an organism reproduces, genetic instructions pass from one generation to the next. For this to occur, there must be a means of copying the instructions. Long before DNA was identified as the genetic material, some people proposed that gene-copying must be based on a template mechanism. A template mechanism works like the negative and photograph example described in the introduction. The cell somehow uses a "negative" of the DNA to make more DNA.</p>

<p>Watson and Crick's model for DNA structure immediately suggested to them that DNA-copying involved a template mechanism. Their hypothesis was based on the specific pairing rules of complementary bases: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. If you know the sequence of bases on one strand of DNA, you can determine the sequence on the other by applying these rules.</p>

<p>Watson and Crick's hypothesis was confirmed by experiments performed in the 1950s. During DNA copying, the two strands of the double helix separate. Each single strand acts as a "negative" for producing a new, complementary strand (Figure 11-9). Nucleotides line up one at a time across from the existing strand as predicted by the base-pairing rules. Enzymes link the nucleotides together and form the two new DNA strands, called daughter strands. This process of copying the DNA molecule is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdnarepl.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdnarepl.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">DNA replication</a>.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Replication of the Double Helix </span><br>
More than a dozen enzymes are involved in DNA replication. Each "incoming" nucleotide pairs with its complementary nucleotide on the parent strand. Enzymes called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdnapoly.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdnapoly.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">DNA polymerases</a> (PAHL ih mur ayz ez) make the covalent bonds between the nucleotides of the new DNA strand. The process is fast and amazingly accurate&#151;an error occurs in only about one of a billion nucleotides. </p>

<p>DNA replication begins at specific sites called origins of replication. The copying proceeds outward in both directions, creating replication "bubbles" (Figure 11-10). The parent DNA strands open up as daughter strands grow on both sides of each bubble. A eukaryotic DNA molecule has many origins where replication can start at the same time. This shortens the total time to copy all the DNA. Eventually, all the bubbles merge, yielding two double-stranded DNA molecules, each with one new and one old strand.</p>

<p>DNA replication occurs before a cell divides, ensuring that the cells in a multicellular organism all carry the same genetic information. It is also the mechanism for producing the DNA copies that offspring inherit from parents during reproduction. </p>
