<p>Different elements have different properties. Some are solid metals at room temperature. Some are invisible gases. Some elements readily react with other elements, while others hardly react at all. These properties affect the roles that different elements play in biological processes. This section describes how an element's properties are related to its structure.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Atoms</span><br>
Each element consists of a single kind of atom that is different from the atoms of all other elements. An <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gatom.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gatom.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">atom</a>, which gets its name from the Greek word <i>atomos</i> meaning "indivisible," is the smallest possible particle of an element. In other words, a carbon atom is the smallest possible "piece" of the element carbon. And that's a very small piece&#151;it would take more than three million carbon atoms to stretch across the period printed at the end of this sentence.</p> 

<p>Atoms of all elements are made up of even smaller components called subatomic particles. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gproton.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gproton.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">proton</a> is a subatomic particle with a single unit of positive electrical charge (+). An <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gelectro.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gelectro.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">electron</a> is a subatomic particle with a single unit of negative electrical charge (-). A third type of subatomic particle, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gneutron.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gneutron.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">neutron</a>, is electrically neutral, meaning it has no electrical charge. An element's physical and chemical properties depend on the number and arrangement of its subatomic particles. For example, the shiny luster of copper metal and the boxy crystals of sulfur are based on the structure and interactions of the atoms that make up those elements.</p>

<p>An atom's protons and neutrons are tightly packed together, forming a central core called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleus.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleus.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nucleus</a>. Electrons, which have much less mass than neutrons and protons, continually move about the outside of the nucleus at great speed. The attraction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged protons keeps the electrons close to the nucleus.</p>

<p>Notice that the model of the helium atom in Figure 4-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in its nucleus. This model, which is not drawn to scale, represents the moving electrons as a spherical "cloud" of negative charge surrounding the nucleus. Because the exact path of any electron cannot be determined, the cloud model is helpful. An electron may visit every point around a nucleus over time. Thus you can think of the electron's negative charge as spread out, like a cloud, in all the places the electron might be. In a real atom, the electron cloud is much larger than the nucleus. To give you an idea of the difference, consider that if the electron cloud of an atom were big enough to fill a baseball stadium, the nucleus would be only the size of a housefly on the field!</p>

<p>An important difference among elements is the number of protons in their atoms. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons, known as the element's <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gatomicn.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gatomicn.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">atomic number</a>. Thus, a helium atom, with 2 protons, has an atomic number of 2. Left alone, an atom tends to hold as many electrons as protons. In that state, the atom is electrically neutral&#151;the positive charges on the protons exactly balance the negative charges on the electrons. However, the number of electrons is not constant like the number of protons. Certain atoms can lose one or more electrons, while some atoms can gain one or two electrons. As you'll see later, the number of electrons determines how the atom interacts with other atoms. Indirectly then&#151;by setting the usual number of electrons&#151;the number of protons determines the atom's properties. No two elements have the same atomic number (proton number), so no two elements have the exact same chemical behavior.</p>						

<p><span class="setextsub">Isotopes</span><br>
Some elements have alternate forms called isotopes. <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gisotope.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gisotope.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Isotopes</a> of an element have the same number of protons in their atoms but different numbers of neutrons. Figure 4-5 shows the numbers of subatomic particles in atoms of the three isotopes of carbon. Carbon-12 (usually written <span class="sub"><sup>12</sup></span>C), which has atoms containing 6 neutrons, makes up about 99 percent of all naturally occurring carbon. Most of the other 1 percent is carbon-13 (<span class="sub"><sup>13</sup></span>C), which has atoms with 7 neutrons. A third isotope, carbon-14 (<span class="sub"><sup>14</sup></span>C), has atoms with 8 neutrons and is very rare. Notice that atoms of all three carbon isotopes still have 6 protons&#151;otherwise, they would not be carbon. Both <span class="sub"><sup>12</sup></span>C and <span class="sub"><sup>13</sup></span>C are stable isotopes, meaning their nuclei do not change with time. The isotope <span class="sub"><sup>14</sup></span>C, on the other hand, is unstable, or radioactive. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gradioac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gradioac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">radioactive isotope</a> is one in which the nucleus decays (breaks down) over time, giving off radiation in the form of matter and energy.</p>

The isotopes are named for the total number of particles in their nuclei (protons plus neutrons). Carbon-13, for example, has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, for a total of 13.</span></td>

<p>Radioactive isotopes have many uses in research and medicine. Living cells use radioactive isotopes just as they would use the nonradioactive forms. Thus, radioactive isotopes are useful as "biological spies" for observing what happens to different atoms within organisms. Scientists can track the presence of radioactive isotopes with instruments that detect radioactive decay. Though radioactive isotopes have many beneficial uses, the particles and energy they give off can also damage cells. However, the doses of most isotopes used in medical diagnosis, such as a body scan, are relatively safe.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Electrons and Reactivity</span><br>How does an atom's structure determine how it reacts with other atoms? The key is the atom's electrons. Electrons differ in the amount of energy they have and how tightly they are held by the protons in the nucleus. Based on these properties, chemists describe an atom's electrons as belonging to certain  energy levels. Usually it is the electrons in the highest energy level of an atom that determine how that atom reacts.</p>

<p>The first, or lowest, energy level (nearest the nucleus) can hold 2 electrons, while the second energy level can hold 8 electrons. For example, a hydrogen atom has 1 electron. Since electrons fill the lowest energy level first, hydrogen's electron occupies its first energy level (Figure 4-7).</p>

Notice that the second energy levels of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are unfilled with 4, 5, and 6 electrons, respectively. (Remember that atomic models are limited in what they can represent. Energy levels are not actual physical locations.)</span></td>

<p>Helium (modeled in Figure 4-4) has 2 electrons, filling its lowest energy level. Carbon has 2 electrons in its lowest energy level, and 4 more electrons in its second level. Note that both hydrogen and carbon have a partly-filled energy level, as do nitrogen and oxygen. That condition makes these atoms chemically reactive&#151;they tend to react with other atoms, filling their highest occupied energy levels. In contrast, a helium atom, which has no partly-filled energy levels, is inert&#151;it does not tend to react. In the next section, you'll read more about the ways electrons are involved in the reactions among atoms.</p>
