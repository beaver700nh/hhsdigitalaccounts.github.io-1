<p>All living things are dependent on water. Inside your body, your cells are surrounded by a fluid that is mostly water, and your cells themselves are 70 to 95 percent water. The abundance of water is a major reason Earth can support life. Water is so common that it is easy to overlook its extraordinary properties, which are linked to the structure and interactions of its molecules.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Structure of Water</span><br>
A water molecule at first may seem pretty simple. Its two hydrogen atoms are each joined to an oxygen atom by a single covalent bond (Figure 4-12).</p> 

						<p align="center"><table width="331" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 4-12<br>Hydrogen bonds form readily among polar water molecules.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>However, the key to water's unusual properties is that the electrons of each covalent bond are not shared equally between oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Oxygen pulls electrons much more strongly than does hydrogen. Part of the reason is that the oxygen nucleus has eight protons, and therefore has a stronger positive charge than the hydrogen nucleus, which has one proton. This unequal pull results in the shared electrons spending more of their time in the "neighborhood" of the oxygen atom. Note the "V" shape of the water molecule, with the oxygen atom at the base of the "V" opposite the two hydrogen atoms. The unequal sharing of electrons causes the oxygen end of the molecule to have a slight negative charge, while the end with the two hydrogen atoms is slightly positive. A molecule in which opposite ends have opposite electric charges is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolarmo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolarmo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">polar molecule</a>. Water is a compound consisting of polar molecules.</p> 

<p>Water molecules are attracted to one another in a specific way. The slightly negative oxygen end of one molecule attracts the slightly positive hydrogen ends of adjacent water molecules, causing the molecules to become arranged as you see in Figure 4-12. This type of weak attraction between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and a slightly negative atom within another molecule is a type of chemical bond called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghydroge.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghydroge.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hydrogen bond</a>. Because the atoms within the water molecules have not transferred an electron (and thus a full unit of charge) to another atom, the attraction in a hydrogen bond is not as strong as that in an ionic bond.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Water's Life-Supporting Properties</span><br>
The polar nature of water and the effects of hydrogen bonding explain most of water's unique properties. These properties include cohesion and adhesion, temperature moderation, the lower density of ice compared to liquid water, and water's ability to dissolve other substances.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Cohesion and Adhesion</span>  Each hydrogen bond between molecules of liquid water lasts for only a few trillionths of a second. Yet, at any instant most of the molecules are involved in hydrogen bonding with other molecules because new hydrogen bonds form as fast as old ones break. This tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick to one another is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcohesio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcohesio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cohesion</a>. Cohesion is much stronger for water than for most other liquids. Water molecules are also attracted to certain other molecules. The type of attraction that occurs between unlike molecules is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gadhesio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gadhesio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">adhesion</a>.</p>

<p>Both cohesion and adhesion are important in the living world. One of the most important effects of these forces is keeping large molecules organized and arranged in a way that enables them to function properly in cells. You will read more about this role of water in Chapters 5 and 6.</p>

<p>As another example, trees depend on cohesion and adhesion to help transport water from their roots to their leaves (Figure 4-13). The evaporation of water from leaves pulls water upward from the roots through narrow tubes in the trunk of the tree. Adhesion between water molecules and the walls of the tubes helps resist the downward pull of gravity on the water. And because of cohesion between water molecules, the pulling force caused by evaporation from the leaves is relayed through the tubes all the way down to the roots. As a result, water moves against the force of gravity even to the top of a very tall tree. You've witnessed another example of cohesion if you've ever seen an insect "skating" across the surface of a pond. Cohesion pulls the molecules at the surface tightly together, forming a filmlike boundary that can support the insect. This effect is known as surface tension.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Temperature Moderation</span>  If you have ever burned your finger on a metal pot while waiting for the water in it to boil, you know that water heats up much more slowly than metal. In fact, because of hydrogen bonding, water has a better ability to resist temperature change than most other substances. To understand why, it is first helpful to know a little about energy and temperature. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthermal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthermal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Thermal energy</a> is the total amount of energy associated with the random movement of atoms and molecules in a sample of matter. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtempera.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtempera.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Temperature</a> is a measure of the average energy of random motion of the particles in a substance. When two substances differ in temperature, thermal energy in the form of heat is transferred from the warmer substance to the cooler one.</p>

<p>When you heat a substance&#151;such as a metal pan or water&#151;its temperature rises because its molecules move faster. But in water, some of the thermal energy that is absorbed goes to break hydrogen bonds. That doesn't happen in the metal pan, which has no hydrogen bonds. As a result, the water absorbs the same amount of thermal energy but undergoes less temperature change than the metal. Conversely, when you cool a substance, the molecules slow and the temperature drops. But as water cools, it forms hydrogen bonds. This releases thermal energy in the form of heat, so there is less of a drop in temperature than in metal.</p>

<p>One result of this property is that it causes oceans and large lakes to moderate the temperatures of nearby land areas. In other words, coastal areas generally have less extreme temperatures than inland areas. For example, a large lake can store a huge amount of thermal energy from the sun during the day. Then at night, heat given off by the gradually cooling water moderates the otherwise more rapid cooling of the air and land.</p>

<p>Water also moderates temperature through evaporation, such as when you sweat. Evaporation occurs when molecules at the surface of a liquid escape to the air. As water molecules evaporate, the remaining liquid becomes cooler. The process of evaporation requires thermal energy to break hydrogen bonds and release water molecules into the air. In sweating, this energy is absorbed from the skin, cooling the body.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Low Density of Ice</span>  Density is the amount of matter in a given volume. A high-density substance is more tightly "packed" than a low-density substance. In most substances, the solid state is more dense than the liquid state. Water is just the opposite&#151;its solid form (ice) is less dense than the cold liquid form. Once again, hydrogen bonds are the reason. Every water molecule in ice forms four long-lasting hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules, which keep the molecules spaced in a regular pattern (Figure 4-15). Because the molecules in liquid water are moving faster than those in ice, there are fewer and more short-lived hydrogen bonds between molecules. The liquid water molecules can fit more closely together than the molecules in ice. Since substances of lesser density float in substances of greater density, ice floats in liquid water.</p>

<p>How is the fact that ice floats important to living things? If ice sank, it would form on the bottom of a body of water as the water was cooling. Ponds and lakes would freeze from the bottom up, trapping the fish and other organisms in a shrinking layer of water without access to the nutrients from the muddy bottom. Instead, when a deep body of water cools, the floating ice insulates the liquid water below, allowing life to persist under the frozen surface.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Water's Ability to Dissolve Other Substances</span>  When you stir table salt into a glass of water, you are forming a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsolutio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsolutio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">solution</a>, a uniform mixture of two or more substances. The substance that dissolves the other substance and is present in the greater amount is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsolvent.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsolvent.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">solvent</a> (in this case, water). The substance that is dissolved and is present in a lesser amount is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsolute.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsolute.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">solute</a> (in this case, salt). When water is the solvent, the result is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaqueous.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaqueous.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">aqueous solution</a> (from the Latin word <i>aqua,</i> "water").</p>						

<p>Water is the main solvent inside all cells, in blood, and in plant sap. Water dissolves an enormous variety of solutes necessary for life. Figure 4-16 illustrates how water dissolves ionic compounds such as table salt (sodium chloride). The positive sodium ions at the surface of a sodium chloride crystal attract the oxygen ends of the water molecules. The negative chloride ions attract the hydrogen ends of the water molecules. As a result, water molecules surround each ion, breaking the salt crystal apart in the process.</p>

						</table></p>
						
<p>Water can also dissolve many nonionic compounds, such as sugars. The structures of sugar molecules include polar areas where electrons are shared unevenly between atoms. These areas of slight electric charge attract the polar ends of water molecules. Water molecules cling to these charged regions and separate the sugar molecules from one another.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Acids, Bases, and pH</span><br>
In aqueous solutions, a very small percentage of the water molecules themselves break apart into ions. The ions formed are positively charged hydrogen ions (H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) and negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span>). (A hydroxide ion is a combination of an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom that carries a 1<span class="sub">-</span> charge.) For the chemical processes of life to work correctly, the right balance of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions and OH<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span> ions is critical.</p> 

<p>Some chemical compounds contribute additional H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions to an aqueous solution while others remove H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions from it. A compound that donates H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions to a solution is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gacid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gacid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">acid</a>. An example is hydrochloric acid (HCl), the acid in your stomach. In an aqueous solution, hydrochloric acid breaks apart completely into H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> and Cl<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span> ions. A compound that removes H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions from an aqueous solution is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbase.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbase.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">base</a>. Some bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), do this by adding OH<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span> ions, which then combine with H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions and form water molecules.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The pH Scale</span>  The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphscale.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphscale.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pH scale</a> describes how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale ranges from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic) (Figure 4-17). Each pH unit represents a tenfold change in the concentration of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions. For example, lemon juice at pH 2 has 10 times more H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions than an equal amount of grapefruit juice at pH 3. Pure water and aqueous solutions that have equal amounts of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> and OH<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span> ions are said to be neutral. They have a pH of 7 and are neither acidic nor basic. The pH of the solution inside most living cells is close to 7.</p>

						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Buffers</span>  Because the molecules in cells are very sensitive to concentrations of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> and OH<span class="sub"><sup>-</sup></span> ions, even a slight change in pH can be harmful to organisms. Many biological fluids contain <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbuffer.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbuffer.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">buffers</a>, substances that cause a solution to resist changes in pH. A buffer works by accepting H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions when their levels rise and donating H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions when their levels fall, thereby maintaining a fairly constant pH in the solution. An example of the importance of buffers is their role in regulating the pH of the blood. Human blood normally has a pH of about 7.4. Certain chemical reactions within your cells can lead to an increase in the amount of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions. When these ions move into the blood, buffers take up some of them, preventing the blood from becoming acidic enough to endanger cell function.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">An Environment Fit for Life</span><br>
You have just explored some of the unique properties of water&#151;an essential substance of life. The abundance of liquid water is one example of how conditions on Earth provide a favorable environment for life. Another condition is the planet's location in the solar system. Earth is far enough from the sun that the planet receives a moderate quantity of the energy radiating from the sun, but not so far away that temperatures are too cold to sustain life. At the same time, ozone (a gas made of oxygen atoms) in Earth's upper atmosphere shields the planet's surface from some of the sun's harmful radiation. Yet another factor is the availability in the soil, rock, and atmosphere of elements essential to life. As you will read in Chapter 36, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are recycled through living and nonliving parts of the environment and so are constantly available to living organisms. In the next chapter, you will explore how these essential elements are arranged into the molecules of life. </p>
