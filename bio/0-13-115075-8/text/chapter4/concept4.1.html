<p>Are you wondering why you're reading about chemistry in a biology textbook? The answer is that all of biology involves chemistry. All living things share the same chemical building blocks and depend on chemical processes for survival.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Elements</span><br>
Humans and other organisms and everything around them are examples of matter. <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmatter.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmatter.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Matter</a> is anything that occupies space and has mass&#151;the physical "stuff" of the universe. Rock, wood, air, metal, water, and animals are all matter.</p> 

<p>The various forms of matter are composed of one or more chemical elements. An <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gelement.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gelement.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">element</a> is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into other substances by chemical means. Examples of naturally occurring elements include some you have probably heard of, such as gold, helium, mercury, and oxygen. Elements are often described as the "basic ingredients" of matter because the more complex forms of matter (including you) are made from elements.</p>

<p>About 25 elements are essential to life (Figure 4-1). Four of these elements&#151;oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N)&#151;make up about 96 percent of the living matter in your body. Calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), and a few other elements account for most of the remaining 4 percent. <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtraceel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtraceel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Trace elements</a>, elements that make up less than 0.01 percent of your body mass, are nevertheless critical to your health. For example, you need about 0.15 milligram (mg) of the trace element iodine each day. If you don't get enough iodine, your thyroid gland (a gland in your throat that regulates certain chemical processes in your body) does not function properly. Another trace element, iron, makes up only about 0.004 percent of your body mass, but it is essential for carrying oxygen in your blood. Examples of other trace elements include copper, fluorine, manganese, and selenium. A balanced diet will usually provide you with the trace elements you need.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Compounds</span><br>
Most elements can interact with other elements, forming more complex types of matter called compounds. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcompoun.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcompoun.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">compound</a> is a substance containing two or more elements that are chemically combined in a fixed ratio. For example, water (H<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>O) is a compound that always contains the same ratio of hydrogen combined with oxygen.</p> 

<p>A compound's properties may differ greatly from those of its component elements. The white crystals of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), on a pretzel look very different from the silvery gray sodium metal and yellowish-green chlorine gas. Similarly, while water is a liquid at room temperature, both oxygen and hydrogen in their elemental form are gases.</p>

<p>Though simple compounds like sodium chloride and water play important roles in living things, most compounds found in organisms are more complex, containing at least three or four elements. For example, the sugars in flower nectar and in maple tree sap are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The compounds in the muscles that wag a dog's tail or blink your eyes consist mostly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</p>
