<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>19.</b> The diagrams below represent atoms of carbon and hydrogen. These two elements can combine to form the compound methane, which has a ratio of one carbon atom to four hydrogen atoms in its molecules. Using these diagrams and colored pencils or pens, draw a model of a molecule of methane. Then write the chemical formula for the compound.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>20. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the diagrams of atoms below to answer the following questions:<br>
<b>a.</b> What is the relationship between these two atoms of oxygen? Explain.<br>
<b>b.</b> What is the atomic number of oxygen? How do you know?<br>
<b>c.</b> How many covalent bonds can either one of these oxygen atoms form? Explain.</p>

	<p align="center"><img src="04images/04-cr-20.gif" width="319" height="177" ALT="diagrams of oxygen atoms"></p>

<p><b>21. Analyzing Data</b> Use the data table below to answer the following questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> Which sample in the table is most acidic?<br>
<b>b.</b> Which sample listed has a pH that is closest to neutral?<br>
<b>c.</b> In equal volumes of normal rainfall and baking soda solution, which sample would   have a greater amount of hydrogen ions (H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) present? Explain.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="04images/04-cr-21.gif" width="268" height="239" ALT="table of pH Values of Similar Solutions"></p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>22. Relating Cause and Effect</b> Element X has 8 electrons in the highest energy level of its atoms. Is element X likely to be very reactive? Explain.</p>
  
<p><b>23. Comparing and Contrasting</b> How is an aqueous solution of table salt different from an aqueous solution of table sugar? Describe how each solution forms.</p>

<p><b>24. Evaluating Promotional Claims</b> Suppose a cosmetics manufacturer advertises a shampoo as "having a pH as gentle as rainwater." Describe how you might determine whether the promotional claim is valid.</p>

<p><b>25. Making Generalizations</b> How is energy involved in the chemical reaction that produces water from hydrogen and oxygen?</p>

<p><b>26. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> An ion is electrically neutral.<br>
<b>b.</b> A chemical reaction occurs whenever matter is created.<br>
<b>c.</b> Ice floats because it is lighter than liquid water.<br></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> You have learned that attractions between water molecules help move water through a plant. Design an experiment that would demonstrate that the direction of this movement is from the roots to the leaves and not the opposite.</p>
