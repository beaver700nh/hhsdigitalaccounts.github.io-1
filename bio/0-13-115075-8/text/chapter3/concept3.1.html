      <p>Have you ever observed a pet cat or dog at play and wondered what the 
        animal's behavior meant? For thousands of years, people have been curious 
        about the activities of other animals that share their surroundings.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Asking Questions About Animal Behavior</span><br>
        When you ask questions about an animal's actions, you are taking the first 
        step in the study of <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganimalb.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganimalb.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">animal 
        behavior</a>&#151;what an animal does as it interacts with its environment. 
      </p>
      <p>For example, in observing the humpback whales you read about in this 
        chapter's introduction, you might ask many questions about their distinctive 
        behaviors. Consider the spectacular scene illustrated in Figure 3-1. As 
        the humpback whale spirals to the surface, it releases a stream of bubbles. 
        What is the function of this bubble-blowing behavior? Through many observations, 
        biologists learned that this "bubble net" temporarily traps small fish 
        and shrimp on which the whale feeds. This observation raises further questions. 
        What causes the whale to blow bubbles? Is this behavior learned, or is 
        the whale born knowing how to use bubble nets? These questions in turn 
        can set a direction for further inquiry.</p>

      <p>You read in Chapter 2 that scientists rely on two approaches to explore 
        life: discovery science (observation and careful description) and hypothesis-based 
        science (testing explanations, usually with experiments). As in other 
        areas of biology, most investigations of animal behavior involve some 
        combination of these two approaches. Often, the scientist observes an 
        animal closely and describes an interesting behavior (discovery science). 
        This leads to asking a question about the behavior and developing a testable 
        hypothesis to explain it (hypothesis-based science).</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Observing Behavior in Natural Environments</span><br>
        When scientists study animals in the wild, using controlled experiments 
        to test hypotheses is often impractical. Imagine trying to carry out controlled 
        experiments to answer questions about humpback whale behaviors. The animals 
        are too large and range too far to study in a controlled experiment. But 
        that does not mean that the questions are unanswerable. In such situations, 
        scientists can test their hypotheses through further observation.</p>
      <p>One example is Jane Goodall's field study on chimpanzees (introduced 
        in Chapter 2). Dr. Goodall's tools were minimal: a notebook, binoculars, 
        and patience. When she began studying the chimps, she was only able to 
        glimpse the chimps from afar. After six months the chimps allowed her 
        to approach close enough to make detailed observations. By this time she 
        could recognize many of the individual chimps, and she gave them names 
        to distinguish them in her notes. By tracking individuals she noticed 
        patterns in the animals' interactions with each other. Each animal had 
        a social rank within the group. She hypothesized that higher-ranking chimps 
        must have certain advantages over lower-ranking chimps. Her further observations 
        of female chimps supported this hypothesis. The highest-ranking females 
        had access to the best food and could thus provide their infants with 
        the richest milk.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Designing Experiments on Animal Behavior</span><br>
        As you learned in Chapter 2, scientists often design experiments to test 
        their hypotheses. Sometimes it is even possible to conduct experiments 
        on an animal's behavior in its natural environment, as the following example 
        shows.</p>
      <p>In the 1920s, an insect called a digger wasp sparked the curiosity of 
        Dutch biologist Niko Tinbergen. Female digger wasps build their nests 
        in a small burrow in sandy ground. The nest consists of four or five cells 
        branching from a main tunnel. After laying an egg in each cell, the wasp 
        flies off to hunt bees, which she paralyzes and carries back to the nest 
        to feed her young. Tinbergen observed this behavior among several female 
        wasps in a small area with many burrows. He wondered whether each wasp 
        returned to only her own nest. By marking the wasps with different-colored 
        drops of paint, he was able to track individuals and conclude that they 
        did return to only their own nests.</p>
      <p>Next he asked, "How does each wasp keep track of her nests?" Tinbergen 
        hypothesized that the wasps use landmarks to locate their burrows. To 
        test his hypothesis, he placed a circle of pine cones around a nest opening 
        (Figure 3-3). He observed that when a female wasp emerged from her nest, 
        she sometimes flew about as if she were getting her bearings. When the 
        wasp flew away, he moved the pine cones to one side of the nest. The next 
        time the wasp returned, she flew to the center of the pine-cone circle 
        instead of the actual nest. Tinbergen concluded that the wasp did use 
        landmarks to find her nests, and that she could learn new ones.</p>
        
        <p align="center">
      <table width="400" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td align="center"><img src="03images/03-03.gif" width="400" height="508" ALT="Figure 3-3"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 3-3<br>
            Tinbergen used simple materials in his experiment&#151;pine cones 
            and stones&#151;and a simple procedure. The results led him to conclude that digger wasps use a pattern of landmarks to find their nests.</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      
      <p>Tinbergen's results raised a new question: Did the wasp respond to the 
        pine cones themselves or to their circular arrangement? To answer this, 
        Tinbergen arranged the pine cones in a triangle around the nest and made 
        a circle of small stones off to one side of the nest opening. This time, 
        the wasp flew to the stones, indicating that she was responding to the 
        arrangement of the landmarks rather than the landmarks themselves. </p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Immediate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior</span><br>
        Tinbergen's studies looked for the <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gimmedia.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gimmedia.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">immediate cause</a> of the wasp's behavior&#151;that 
        is, an explanation in terms of the organism's immediate interactions with 
        the environment. Such explanations usually answer "how" questions. For 
        example, the immediate cause of nest-locating behavior is the wasp's ability 
        to recognize an arrangement of landmarks. This observation answers "how" 
        the wasp locates her nest. </p>
      <p>But behavioral biologists also ask "why" questions&#151;why do organisms 
        behave as they do? Answering "why" questions involves finding the <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gultimat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gultimat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ultimate 
        cause</a> of a behavior&#151;an explanation based on the organism's evolutionary 
        adaptations. How did the behavior first arise? What is the function of 
        the behavior&#151;in other words, how does it help the organism to survive 
        and reproduce?</p>
      <p>To illustrate the difference between immediate and ultimate causes of 
        behavior, consider this example. When you accidentally touch a hot plate, 
        your arm quickly pulls away. The immediate cause of this behavior&#151;the 
        how&#151;is the reaction of your nervous system, which sends signals to 
        the muscles in your arm. A reasonable hypothesis for the ultimate cause&#151;the 
        why&#151;is that natural selection has favored this response, which minimizes 
        damage to the body in a dangerous situation.</p>
