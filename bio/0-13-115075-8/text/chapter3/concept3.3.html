      <p>You never had to learn to jerk your hand away from a hot stovetop. That 
        reflex is an innate behavior. But such a painful experience does help 
        you learn to avoid touching hot surfaces in the future. Of course, you 
        are also capable of learning far more complex lessons. A human's ability 
        to learn is unmatched in the animal kingdom. Perhaps that is why many 
        people find investigations into the biology of learning particularly engaging. Humans have much to learn about learning!</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Habituation</span><br>
        A change in an animal's behavior resulting from experience is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glearnin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glearnin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">learning</a>. 
        A simple form of learning is <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghabitua.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghabitua.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">habituation</a>, 
        in which an animal learns not to respond to a repeated stimulus that conveys little or no important information. Think of something you hear that carries no meaning, like the ticking of a clock. Eventually, you stop paying attention to it. Once habituated to a stimulus, an animal still senses the stimulus&#151;its sensory organs detect it&#151;but the animal has learned not to respond. In other words, your ears detect the clock's constant sounds, but after awhile your brain does not initiate a response.</p>
      <p>Many animals undergo habituation. For example, a microscopic freshwater 
        organism, the hydra, contracts when disturbed by a slight touch. However, if it is disturbed repeatedly by such a stimulus, the hydra stops responding. Likewise, scarecrows can keep birds away from a garden for a time. But the birds soon become habituated to the scarecrow and may even land on 
        it on their way to the garden. </p>
      <p>How does habituation benefit an animal? One hypothesis is that habituation allows an animal's nervous system to focus on stimuli that signal food, mates, or real danger, and not waste time or energy on other, less important stimuli.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Imprinting</span><br>
        Many behaviors have both learned and unlearned components. Some of the 
        most interesting cases involve imprinting. <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/gimprint.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/gimprint.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Imprinting</a> 
        is learning that is limited to a specific time period in an animal's life and that is usually irreversible. One result of imprinting is the formation 
        of a strong bond between two animals, often a newborn and its parent.</p>
      <p>In a famous study, Konrad Lorenz used the graylag goose to study imprinting. He divided a batch of eggs from a nest, leaving some with the mother and putting the rest in an incubator. The young reared by the mother served as the control group. They showed normal behavior, following their mother as goslings and eventually growing up, mating, and interacting with other geese. The geese from the artificially incubated eggs formed the experimental 
        group. These geese spent their first two days after hatching with Lorenz 
        rather than with their mother. From then on, they followed Lorenz and 
        showed no recognition of their mother or other adults of their own species. This early imprinting lingered into adulthood. The birds continued to 
        prefer the company of Lorenz and even other humans to that of their own 
        species. In contrast to other kinds of learning, imprinting takes place 
        during a particular time period in an animal's development called a <i>critical learning period</i>. For example, Lorenz found that the critical period for 
        graylag geese is the first two days after hatching. If geese were isolated 
        from any moving objects during those first two days, they failed to imprint 
        on anything afterward. </p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Conditioning</span><br>
        Learning that a particular stimulus or a particular response is linked 
        to a reward or punishment is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gconditi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gconditi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">conditioning</a>. If you have a pet, you probably have observed many examples of conditioning. For example, a cat may associate the sound of a can opener with mealtime. A dog may associate a hand signal or command with a particular behavior&#151;heeling or staying still. This type of learning, in which an otherwise meaningless stimulus is associated with a reward or a punishment, is called <i>classical conditioning</i>. Eventually, the animal learns to respond to the stimulus even in the absence of a reward or punishment. The scientist Ivan Pavlov conducted a famous experiment on classical conditioning in which he trained a dog to salivate  at the sound of a bell (Figure 3-12).</p>

            In a classical conditioning experiment, Pavlov trained a dog to associate a ringing bell with food. Afterward, when the dog heard the bell, it would begin to salivate even when no food was present.</span></td>

      </p>
      
      <p>In nature, a much more common form of conditioning is <i>operant conditioning</i>, 
        also called trial-and-error learning. An animal learns to associate one 
        of its own behavioral acts with a positive or negative effect. The animal 
        tends to repeat the response if it is rewarded, but avoids the response 
        if it is harmed. For example, predators quickly learn to associate certain 
        kinds of prey with painful experiences. A coyote may learned the hard 
        way not to attack a porcupine nose-first. Learning by trial and error 
        often reinforces behaviors that are important to survival.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Insight</span><br>
        At a level above operant conditioning is the ability to respond appropriately 
        to a new situation without previous experience, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginsight.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginsight.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">insight</a> 
        or innovation. Insight involves the ability to analyze problems and to 
        test possible solutions. For example, an octopus can figure out how to 
        unscrew the lid of a jar and obtain the food inside. Since in nature an 
        octopus never obtains food exactly in this manner, researchers infer that 
        the octopus' behavior represents insight. In another example, a chimpanzee 
        was placed in a room with several boxes on the floor and a banana hung 
        high above its head. The chimp eventually "sized up" the situation and 
        then stacked the boxes in order to reach the food.</p>
      <p>Since it takes place without previous experience, insight is not technically 
        a form of learning. However, successful insight contributes to learning. 
        (The same chimp solves the same problem faster the next time.) Furthermore, 
        insight may itself be based on trial-and-error experience with related 
        problems. In this example, the chimp may have once stood on a rock or 
        tree stump to reach food. Here, the chimp demonstrates insight by applying 
        a past experience to a new, slightly different situation.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Play Behavior</span><br>
        Many mammals and some birds engage in behavior that can best be described 
        as play. For example, young foxes playfully stalk and "attack" their parents 
        or siblings. Although the bites are not usually painful, the animals grab 
        one another using movements similar to those used to capture and kill 
        prey.</p>
      <p>Play obviously consumes energy, and can even risk damaging the animals' 
        bodies. What could be the ultimate cause for such seemingly pointless 
        behavior? One hypothesis suggests that play is a type of learning that 
        allows animals to practice behaviors required for survival. This "practice 
        hypothesis" is supported by the observation that play is most common in 
        young animals. However, researchers observe that young animals don't seem 
        to improve their movements much even after a few practices.</p>
      <p>Another ultimate explanation for play is the "exercise hypothesis." This 
        hypothesis suggests that play is an adaptation that keeps the animal's 
        muscular and cardiovascular systems in top condition. The exercise hypothesis 
        also predicts that play should be especially common in young animals, 
        because they typically do not have to exert themselves in useful activities 
        while under the protection and care of their parents. </p>
      <p>Note that both these hypotheses make the same prediction about what to 
        expect from further observation&#151;that young animals should play more 
        than older animals. The data uphold this prediction, but they don't help 
        distinguish which hypothetical explanation is best. Neither the "practice" 
        nor the "exercise" hypothesis can be rejected. For the researcher, the 
        next step is to make further predictions that would help distinguish between 
        the hypotheses.</p>
