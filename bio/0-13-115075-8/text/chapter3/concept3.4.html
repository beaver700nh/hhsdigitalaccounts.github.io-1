      <p>Many animals live in groups (such as colonies of ants, packs of wolves, 
        herds of antelope, pods of whales, and households and communities of people). 
        As part of a group, such social animals may migrate, hunt, feed, or raise 
        young in a way that offers some benefit compared to living alone. Interactions 
        between two or more individuals of the same species are called social 
        behaviors. Careful observations and experiments have resulted in much 
        of the current understanding of social behaviors.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Competitive Behaviors</span><br>
        Animals that live in social groups must sometimes compete for resources 
        such as food, space, or mates. Sometimes these competitions result in 
        conflicts between individuals.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Aggressive Behaviors</span> Actual physical 
        struggles or threatening behaviors between animals are classified as <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaggress.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaggress.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">aggressive 
        behaviors</a>. They include tests of strength or, more commonly, symbolic 
        displays that reveal which individuals are larger, stronger, or more determined. 
        In most cases one individual eventually stops threatening and "surrenders" 
        to the winner. </p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Dominance Hierarchies</span> Aggressive behaviors 
        within a group of animals often result in a ranking of individuals, called 
        a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdomihie.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdomihie.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dominance 
        hierarchy</a>. Once the hierarchy is set, the animals do not need to spend 
        energy fighting with each other. Instead, they can concentrate on finding 
        food, raising young, or other necessary behaviors. For example, if several 
        unfamiliar hens are placed together, they respond by chasing and pecking 
        one another. Eventually, a clear "pecking order" is established, with 
        a ranking from the most dominant to the most submissive individuals. The 
        higher up in the pecking order a hen is, the greater her access to resources 
        such as food, water, and roosting sites.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsubsm">Territorial Behavior</span> Many animals exhibit 
        territorial behavior. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gterrito.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gterrito.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">territory</a> 
        is an area that individuals defend and from which other members of the 
        same species are usually excluded. The size of the territory varies with 
        the species, the territory's function (for example, feeding or raising 
        young), and the resources available. For example, gannets maintain territories 
        just large enough for their nests. Even so, they constantly defend their 
        tiny spaces by calling out and pecking at other birds.</p>
      <p>Individuals that have established a territory usually proclaim their 
        territorial rights continually. This is the function of most bird songs, 
        as well as the noisy bellowing of sea lions and the chattering of squirrels. 
        Scent markers are frequently used by mammals to signal territories. For 
        example, male cheetahs mark their territories by spraying urine on trees. 
        The odor serves as a chemical "No Trespassing" sign. Other males that 
        approach the area sniff the marked tree and recognize that the urine is 
        not their own. Usually, the intruder avoids the marked territory, steering 
        clear of a risky confrontation with its owner. Defending a territory takes 
        energy, but the result can mean exclusive access to food supplies, breeding 
        areas, and places to raise young. </p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Courtship Behavior</span><br>
        In some species, animals perform elaborate behaviors before mating, called 
        a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcourtsh.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcourtsh.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">courtship 
        ritual</a>. Courtship rituals may confirm that individuals are of the 
        same species but of the opposite sex, that they are ready to mate, and 
        perhaps that they are not threats to each other. Certain rituals may also 
        be an opportunity for an animal to advertise positive qualities to a potential 
        mate. For example, an impressive fanning of tail feathers by a peacock 
        may indicate good health to peahens who are choosing mates. Dull, skimpy 
        tail feathers could be caused by infections or other health problems. 
        By choosing a healthy mate, a female is more likely to have healthy offspring. 
        Note that such a behavior is not an example of high-level thinking by 
        the peahens. Rather, it is an example of natural selection refining courtship 
        rituals that improve reproductive success.</p>
      <p>The following case study illustrates how biologists used an experimental 
        approach to investigate courtship rituals in barn swallows. Researchers 
        observed that when males first arrive at their breeding grounds each season, 
        they establish territories and display their long tails. Females choose 
        their mates, and the pair then raise the young together. </p>
      <p>The researchers hypothesized that the length of a male's tail influenced 
        its mating success&#151;the longer a male's tail, the more attractive 
        he is to females. To test this hypothesis they used a control group of 
        male swallows with natural-length tails and three experimental groups: 
        a group with tails cut short, a group with tails extended by gluing on 
        additional feathers, and a group with cut and glued tails of natural length. 
        (The purpose of this last group was to test whether the gluing process 
        itself had any effect on the females' choices.) Figure 3-19 shows the 
        results of the experiment.</p>
        
        <p align="center">
      <table width="425" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td align="center"><img src="03images/03-19.gif" width="425" height="288" ALT="Figure 3-19"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 3-19<br>
            A controlled experiment demonstrated that female barn swallows tend 
            to prefer mates with the longest tails. One hypothesis to explain 
            this result is that a male must be healthy for long tail feathers 
            to develop. Natural selection would favor female birds choosing these longer-tailed males.</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      
      <p>Why would females prefer to mate with males with unusually long tails? 
        As in the peacocks, one hypothesis is that good health is required to 
        produce long feathers. The researchers designed new experiments to test 
        this hypothesis, studying birds with naturally varying tail lengths. They 
        found that long-tailed swallows and their offspring had fewer parasites 
        than short-tailed swallows.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Communication</span><br>
        The social behaviors you have just read about all depend on some form 
        of signaling, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcomcati.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcomcati.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">communication</a>, among the participating animals. Animals 
        use a variety of signals, including sounds, odors, visual displays, and 
        touches. </p>
      <p>Species with complex social structures tend to have complex communication 
        systems. One of the most complex social systems is found in honeybees. 
        In the 1940s, biologist Karl von Frisch carried out several experiments 
        to study bee communication. He put out dishes of sugar water at various 
        distances and directions from a study hive. He also modified the hive 
        so that he could observe the bees inside. Von Frisch observed that worker 
        bees returning to the hive from different dishes performed variations 
        of a "waggle dance." He hypothesized that these dance variations communicated 
        information about the location of the food to other bees in the hive (Figure 
        3-21).</p>
        
        <p align="center">
      <table width="400" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td align="center"><img src="03images/03-21.gif" width="400" height="400" ALT="Figure 3-21"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 3-21<br>
            Von Frisch and later researchers determined that the angle of a returning honeybee's "waggle dance" signals the direction of the food source from the hive compared to the position of the sun.</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="setextsub">Cooperation</span><br>
        The social system of the honeybees is one example of a group of behaviors described as <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcoopera.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcoopera.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cooperation</a>, 
        in which individuals work together in a way that is beneficial to the 
        group. Another example of cooperation is a pack of wolves together capturing a much larger prey animal such as a moose. Musk oxen also cooperate when they form a defensive ring around the young oxen. The complete ring of many 
        adults is more effective in protecting all the young than any one ox defending its own young.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, you have seen many examples of how biologists use a 
        combination of discovery and hypothesis-based science to understand animal behavior. Analyzing these examples will help you use the process of science in your own inquiries in biology.</p>
