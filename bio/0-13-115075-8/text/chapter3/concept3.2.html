      <p>Have you ever heard the phrase "nature versus nurture"? This expression 
        refers to the idea that behavior is due either to genes (nature) or to 
        environmental influences (nurture). For example, is the digger wasp born 
        "knowing" how to use landmarks to find its nests? Or, does each wasp learn 
        this skill during its lifetime? The answer is more complex than either/or. 
        All of an animal's behaviors depend on some combination of genes and environment.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Innate Behaviors</span><br>
        Researchers have observed that digger wasps raised in isolation build 
        nests in the same way as wasps raised among other wasps. The conclusion 
        is that a digger wasp is born "knowing" how to build a nest&#151;it does 
        not have to learn this behavior from another wasp. A behavior that is 
        performed correctly by all individuals of a species, even if they have 
        no previous experience with the behavior, is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginnateb.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginnateb.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">innate 
        behavior</a>.</p>
      <p>Note that this concept of innate behavior does not mean that such behaviors 
        are <i>only</i> determined by genes. Even the most programmed behavior 
        is influenced by the environment. For example, perhaps the appropriate 
        type of sandy nesting site must be available to trigger the wasp's behavior. 
        Furthermore, the wasp has to have the physical skills to carry out the 
        behavior. Both genetic and environmental factors (such as nutrition) contributed 
        to the development of the insect's nervous and muscular systems that together 
        enable it to perform the behavior.</p>
      <p>Niko Tinbergen and Austrian biologist Konrad Lorenz observed innate behaviors 
        in many organisms. One famous study involved an interesting behavior in 
        the graylag goose. If the goose bumps one of her eggs out of her nest 
        area, she always uses her beak to retrieve it in the same way (Figure 
        3-6). When Lorenz and Tinbergen pulled the egg away from the goose during 
        this process, she continued as though the egg were still there. Only after 
        the goose sat down on her nest did she seem to notice that the egg was 
        still outside the nest, and she started the process all over again. The 
        scientists even substituted other objects, such as small toys or balls, 
        for the egg, yet the goose did not alter her behavior.</p>

            The graylag goose responds to an egg outside her nest with a set of 
            specific actions. Even when the egg is removed, the goose will continue to push at the air with her beak until she completes the FAP (fixed 
            action pattern).</span></td>

      <p>The goose's egg-retrieving response is an example of a <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfixedac.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfixedac.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fixed 
        action pattern</a> (abbreviated FAP)&#151;an innate behavior that occurs 
        as an unchangeable sequence of actions. An animal can only perform a FAP 
        as a whole "script," from beginning to end. Once an animal starts a particular 
        FAP, it usually completes the sequence no matter what happens along the 
        way.</p>
      <p>A FAP is usually triggered by a specific stimulus. In the goose example, 
        the stimulus is the sight of an egg (or other similar object) outside 
        the nest. What is the ultimate cause of such behavior? Why might a FAP 
        evolve, even if it could cause the goose to roll a strange object into 
        her nest? A FAP allows an animal to perform a task correctly the first 
        time, without learning the behavior. You might hypothesize that it would 
        increase an organism&#146;s likelihood of success if it could perform 
        important tasks without practicing first. Observations that FAPs often 
        involve activities that are critical to survival and reproductive success, 
        such as feeding or defending offspring, support this hypothesis.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Rhythms of Behavior</span><br>
        Another example of the interplay of programmed behavior with environmental 
        influences is the ability of many animals to synchronize their activities 
        with their environment. For example, if you have traveled to another time 
        zone, you may have experienced "jet lag"&#151;a period when you were "out 
        of sync" with your surroundings. However, within a few days, you were 
        adjusted to the night and day cues in the environment of the new time 
        zone.</p>
      <p>Animals exhibit a great variety of rhythmic (regularly repeated) behavior 
        patterns that are synchronized to rhythmic changes in environmental factors. 
        The patterns may be seasonal, such as mammals that migrate to better feeding 
        grounds during dry seasons. Or they may be daily, such as flying squirrels 
        that are active at night and sleep from dawn to dusk. </p>
      <p>To study the natural rhythms of flying squirrels, researchers placed 
        several squirrels in cages containing running wheels. The researchers 
        traced the activity patterns of the squirrels in two different light conditions 
        for 23 days (Figure 3-8). The control-group graph shows the activity pattern 
        of a squirrel exposed to 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness. 
        The experimental-group graph shows the activity pattern of a squirrel 
        kept in darkness.</p>

            A quantitative experiment with flying squirrels supports the hypothesis that environmental cues influence the animal's activity rhythms. The  wheel in each squirrel's cage was connected to a machine that recorded wheel turns, allowing researchers to track active periods of the squirrels. These graphs display the data collected each 24-hour period from noon to noon. Control-group squirrels were kept in 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness, while the experimental-group squirrels were kept in constant darkness.</span></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      
      <p>Both squirrels had a distinct active period every day. The control squirrel 
        became active at about the same time each day. In contrast, the experimental 
        squirrel's high activity period shifted about 21 minutes later each day. 
        After 23 days, the period had shifted nearly 8 hours from that of the 
        control. When this squirrel returned to a regular cycle of 12 hours of 
        light and 12 hours of dark, its activity cycle matched that of the control 
        squirrel within a few days. These results suggest that without environmental 
        cues, the squirrels kept a daily rhythm of 24 hours, 21 minutes. This 
        type of innate rhythm with a cycle of about 24 hours is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcircadi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcircadi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">circadian 
        rhythm</a> (sur KAY dee uhn). Circadian rhythms are controlled by an organism's 
        internal "biological clock." But note the environmental influence: Daily 
        cycles of light and dark set the organism's biological clock to a cycle 
        of exactly 24 hours. This interaction of environment with genetic programs 
        keeps the squirrel's body rhythms coordinated with its external world.</p>
      <p><span class="setextsub">Investigating the Interaction of Genes and Experience: 
        A Case Study </span><br>
        How can researchers design an experiment to analyze the roles of inheritance 
        and experience in forming a particular behavior? One way is to choose 
        a subject in which you can control the genetic contribution by mating 
        certain organisms. For example, the two closely-related species of lovebirds 
        in Figure 3-9 both build their nests with strips of vegetation cut with 
        their beaks. The Fischer's lovebird cuts long strips and carries them 
        back to the nest site one at a time in its beak. In contrast, the peach-faced 
        lovebird cuts short strips and carries several at a time by tucking them 
        into its feathers. Are these techniques examples of innate behavior, or 
        do the birds learn them from experience?</p>

      </p>
      
      <p>To find the answer, biologists designed an experiment that mated the 
        two lovebird species to produce offspring (called <i>hybrids</i>). A hybrid lovebird 
        cuts strips that are in between the lengths of strips cut by the two parent 
        species. And the hybrid even attempts to carry the strips using a combined 
        technique. For example, the hybrid usually tries tucking the strips under 
        its feathers without releasing them from its beak. After failing to transport 
        the strips under its feathers, it will learn to carry a strip in its beak. 
        But the hybrid will still act out part of the tucking sequence by turning 
        its head to the rear before flying off.</p>
      <p>This experiment suggests that the differences in the behavior of the 
        two species are inherited. However, the observation that the hybrid birds 
        could modify their behavior and build a nest suggests that learning also 
        plays a role in shaping the behavior.</p>
