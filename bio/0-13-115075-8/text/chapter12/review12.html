<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Reviewing Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Multiple Choice</span><br>
<i>Choose the letter of the best answer.</i><br>

<p><b>1.</b> The complete set of genetic material in an organism is called its<br>
 <b>a.</b> chromosome.<br>
 <b>b.</b> histone.<br>
 <b>c.</b> transposon.<br>
 <b>d.</b> genome.</p>
  
 <p><b>2.</b> Trisomy 21 is a condition usually caused by <br>
 <b>a.</b> nondisjunction.<br>
 <b>b.</b> chromosome deletion.<br>
 <b>c.</b> chromosome inversion.<br>
 <b>d.</b> Down syndrome.</p>
 
 <p><b>3.</b> When a fragment of one chromosome attaches to a nonhomologous chromosome, this process is called a<br>
 <b>a.</b> duplication.<br>
 <b>b.</b> translocation.<br>
 <b>c.</b> deletion.<br>
 <b>d.</b> nondisjunction.</p>
 
<p><b>4.</b> What is the probability that each child born to two carriers of a recessive-disorder allele will have the disorder?<br>
 <b>a.</b> 1/3<br>
 <b>b.</b> 1/8<br>
 <b>c.</b> 1/4<br>
 <b>d.</b> 0</p>
 
<p><b>5.</b> A person who is a carrier for a sex-linked recessive disorder<br>
 <b>a.</b> is male.<br>
 <b>b.</b> is heterozygous for the disorder.<br>
 <b>c.</b> is homozygous for the disorder.<br>
 <b>d.</b> cannot pass the allele for the disorder to offspring.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> The chances of cancer developing in an individual increases if a cell that has an oncogene also<br>
 <b>a.</b> has a mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene.<br>
 <b>b.</b> does not make growth factors.<br>
 <b>c.</b> self-destructs.<br>
 <b>d.</b> all of the above.</p>
 
 
<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>7.</b> Describe how 2 meters of DNA can fit inside a cell's nucleus.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> What is the name for the set of symptoms shown by people with trisomy 21? List some of the symptoms.</p>
  
<p><b>9.</b> Which type of chromosomal damage might affect more than one chromosome? Explain.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> How can a tranposon interfere with another gene?</p>

<p><b>11.</b> How can a family pedigree be used to help determine the probability of having a child with a genetic disorder?</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Which are more common, lethal dominant alleles or lethal recessive alleles? Explain your answer.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Why are there more men than women with colorblindness?</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Describe the job of a genetic counselor. </p>

<p><b>15.</b> Is it certain that someone who inherits a cancer gene will get cancer? Explain. </p>


<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>16.</b> Draw three sketches depicting what the chromosomes below would look like after the described damage affects the indicated area.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="12images/12-cr-16.gif" width="225" height="184" alt="diagrams of three chromosomes and three different forms of damage"></p> 
		
<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>17. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the pedigree below to answer the questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> List the names of people with the trait.<br>
<b>b.</b> Is this a recessive or dominant trait? Is it a sex-linked trait? Explain.<br>
<b>c.</b> List the names of any carriers of the trait.<br>
<b>d.</b> If Jan married a man who was heterozygous for this trait, what is the probability that any one of their children would have the trait?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="12images/12-cr-17.gif" width="175" height="196" alt="diagram of a pedigree"></p> 

<p><b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Use the diagram below to answer the questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> On a separate piece of paper, draw the four gametes produced, including the number of chromosomes in each. Explain how each gamete is abnormal.<br>
<b>b.</b> Note that the process shown is simplified, showing only two pairs of chromosomes at meiosis I. In a human, how many pairs of chromosomes would there actually be at meiosis I?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="12images/12-cr-18.gif" width="210" height="242" alt="diagram of Meiosis I and Meiosis II"></p> 

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>19. Evaluating the Impact of Research</b> Describe some benefits of having a complete map of the human genome.</p>
  
<p><b>20. Making Generalizations</b> Which kinds of chromosomal abnormalities would be hard to detect in a karyotype? Explain.</p>

<p><b>21. Problem Solving</b> Note again that the woman whose genotype is unknown in the pedigree for colorblindness (Figure 12-14) has one son with normal vision. Suppose she has a second son who is colorblind. Now can you determine her genotype? Explain. Alternatively, suppose her second son had normal vision. Can you determine her genotype then? Explain.</p>

<p><b>22. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Jumping genes jump from one organism into another.<br>
<b>b.</b> Sex-linked traits don't occur in females.<br>
<b>c.</b> Cancer is a genetic disease and therefore is always inherited.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> Go to the library or the Internet to research non-disorder traits that have simple Mendelian inheritance (like earlobe attachment). Choose one such trait and write a brief report. Include in your report a made-up pedigree that illustrates how the trait is inherited. Be sure that it follows the inheritance rules for the trait.</p>
