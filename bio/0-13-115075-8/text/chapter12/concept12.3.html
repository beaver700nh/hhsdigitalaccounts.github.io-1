<p>In Chapter 10 you read about Mendel's principles, which explain the inheritance patterns of certain characteristics in organisms. In humans, these principles explain the inheritance of certain alleles that help define individual appearance, as well as those responsible for some diseases.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Working With Human Pedigrees </span><br>
Unlike researchers working with pea plants or fruit flies, geneticists who study humans cannot control matings to study the resulting offspring! Instead, they must analyze the patterns in existing families. For example, attached earlobes are an inherited trait. To study their inheritance, you would first need to collect information about a family's history for the trait. Next you would organize the information in a family tree. Then you could analyze this information by applying Mendel's concepts of dominant and recessive alleles and his principle of segregation.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpedigre.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpedigre.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pedigree</a> is a family tree that records and traces the occurrence of a trait in a family. For example, the pedigree in Figure 12-9 records the occurrence of attached earlobes in three generations. A typical pedigree uses squares to represent males and circles to represent females. The colored shapes represent individuals that show the trait. Parents are connected by horizontal lines, with their children beneath them. For example, the couple at the top left of the pedigree below had four children: one girl and three boys.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>The genotypes of most of the individuals in this pedigree can be determined by examining the pattern in which the trait occurs (Figure 12-10). Notice that the first-born daughter in the third generation has attached lobes, although both of her parents have free earlobes. By applying Mendel's principles, you can figure out that the attached-earlobe trait must therefore be recessive. If the trait for attached earlobes were dominant, then at least one of her parents would have attached earlobes. It is possible to figure out the genotypes for most of the other people in the pedigree in this way. For some individuals, such as the second daughter in the third generation, there is not enough information to determine the genotype.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Disorders Inherited as Recessive Traits</span><br>
Pedigree analysis is a more serious matter when the alleles in question cause disabling or lethal (deadly) disorders. Over a thousand human genetic disorders are known to have Mendelian inheritance patterns. Each of these disorders is inherited as a dominant or recessive trait controlled by a single gene. Most human genetic disorders are recessive.</p>

<p>Recessive disorders range in severity. Some such as albinism (lack of skin and hair pigmentation) are not life-threatening. Others such as Tay-Sachs disease, which leads to major nerve damage, are fatal. The vast majority of people with recessive disorders are born to parents who are heterozygous and do not have the recessive disorder. An individual who has one copy of the allele for a recessive disorder and does not exhibit symptoms is a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcarrier.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcarrier.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">carrier</a> of the disorder.</p>

<p>Using Mendel's principles, you can predict the probability that a child of two carriers will have the disorder. For example, one kind of deafness is inherited as a recessive trait. (Note that this is not how all deafness is caused.) Suppose a couple had normal hearing but were carriers of the recessive allele, represented by <i>d</i>. Their genotypes would be <i>Dd.</i> What is the probability that they would have a deaf child? As the Punnett square in Figure 12-11 shows, each child of two carriers has a one in four (1/4) chance of inheriting two recessive alleles. Notice that each child that is born has a 1/4 chance, regardless of the phenotype of their siblings. For example, if the couple's first child is deaf, this does not mean their next three children will have normal hearing. </p>

<p>The recessive allele for a very serious disorder, cystic fibrosis (CF), is carried by about 1 in every 25 people of European ancestry in the United States. The gene involved codes for a protein that functions in the lungs and other organs. A mutation in the gene makes the protein defective. This results in certain organs secreting excessive amounts of very thick mucus. This mucus can interfere with breathing, digestion, and liver function. A person with CF is also particularly vulnerable to pneumonia and other infections. Treatments such as a restricted diet, antibiotics to prevent infection, and exercises to clear the lungs can improve and prolong the lives of people with CF.
</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Disorders Inherited as Dominant Traits</span><br>
A smaller number of human disorders are inherited as dominant traits. One example is being born with extra fingers and toes. A serious dominant disorder is a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia (ay kahn droh PLAY zhuh). The person's head and torso may develop normally, but the arms and legs are short. About 1 out of 25,000 people has achondroplasia. All individuals with this disorder are heterozygous&#151;they have a single copy of the dominant allele. Inheriting two copies of the allele is fatal. More than 99.99% of the population is homozygous for the normal, recessive allele. This example makes it clear that dominant alleles are not necessarily more plentiful than recessive alleles in a population.</p>

<p>Dominant alleles that are lethal are, in fact, much less common than lethal recessives. This is because for most dominant disorders, the affected person dies before producing any offspring that could inherit the allele. (However, the disorder may return to a population if a natural mutation creates a new copy of the dominant allele in a sperm or egg cell.) In contrast, lethal recessive alleles usually do not have a large effect on heterozygous carriers. As a result, alleles for recessive disorders may pass undetected from generation to generation, until two carriers happen to produce a homozygous offspring with the disorder.</p>

<p>Lethal dominant disorders that don't cause death until adulthood can affect multiple generations of a family. By the time the symptoms show, the person may have already transmitted the lethal gene to his or her children. One example is Huntington's disease. Huntington's causes a degeneration of the nervous system that usually does not begin until middle age. As the disease progresses, it causes loss of mental ability and muscle control, and eventually death.</p>

<p>Until recently, it was impossible to tell if a person with a family history of Huntington's disease had actually inherited the allele until the person developed symptoms. But then geneticists tracked the disease allele to chromosome 4 and developed a test to detect it. Researchers now hope to find a treatment that prevents people who carry the allele from ever developing the disease.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sex-linked Disorders</span><br>
Another Mendelian inheritance pattern that occurs in humans involves recessive alleles that are sex-linked. As you learned in Chapter 10, sex-linked alleles are those located on one sex chromosome but not on the other. In humans, most sex-linked alleles are located on the X chromosome. A male only receives such sex-linked alleles from his mother. (The homologous Y chromosome is always inherited from the father.) A male therefore needs only one copy of a sex-linked recessive allele to exhibit the recessive trait. In contrast, a female must inherit two such recessive alleles&#151;one from each parent&#151;to exhibit the trait.</p>

<p>Red-green colorblindness is a common sex-linked disorder that involves a malfunction of light-sensitive cells in the eyes. Some affected people have difficulty distinguishing reds from greens. The pedigree in Figure 12-14 shows the occurrence of colorblindness in four generations of a family. The half-filled circles represent carriers. Circles representing females whose genotypes are unknown are marked with a question mark.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="280" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="12images/12-14.gif" width="280" height="251" ALT="Figure 12-14"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 12-14<br>This pedigree at left shows the appearance of colorblindness in four generations of a family.</span></td>

<p>It is rare&#151;but not impossible&#151;for females to exhibit sex-linked (X-linked) traits. Suppose a woman who is a carrier married a man with a sex-linked trait. There would be a 50 percent chance that any of their children (male or female) would have the trait.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Predicting and Treating Genetic Disorders</span><br>
When two people are considering having children, and one or both has a family history of a genetic disease, it may be helpful for the couple to visit a genetic counselor. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenetic.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenetic.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genetic counselor</a> is trained to collect and analyze data about inheritance patterns and to explain the results and their significance. The genetic counselor examines the couple's family histories for any disorders that have Mendelian inheritance patterns. He or she can also interpret genetic tests performed on the parents to detect disorder alleles (recessive alleles with effects that would be hidden in a carrier, for example). The counselor can then help the couple determine the risk of passing on a disease trait to their child. The knowledge provided by genetic counseling can help couples make informed decisions about whether to have a child or how they might be able to treat the child if a disorder is in fact inherited.</p>

<p>Before a baby is born, doctors can perform certain tests to detect chromosomal and other genetic disorders in the fetus. For example, karyotyping is a test for chromosome abnormalities, such as the trisomy 21 that leads to Down syndrome (see Figure 12-3).Other tests analyze the fluid surrounding the fetus to detect chemical imbalances that point to specific disorders.</p>

<p>Furthermore, standard tests are performed on every baby born at a hospital in the United States, whether or not the baby has any family history for a particular disease. One such test is for phenylketonuria (fen ul kee toh NOOR ee ah), a recessive disorder in which a person cannot process the amino acid phenylalanine. If the baby tests positive for phenylketonuria, the parents can put the baby on a phenylalanine-controlled diet. Such a diet is effective in preventing the mental disability that is characteristic of the untreated disorder.</p>
