<p>Cancer was once a mystery. But now scientists know that the usual cause of cancer is an accumulation of mutations in DNA. As you read in Chapter 11, mutations can be caused by exposure to mutagens such as UV light and certain chemicals. Mutations can also be inherited. Here you will read how several such mutations can add up, sometimes leading to cancer.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Cancer Genes</span><br>
Chapter 9 described what happens when the cell-cycle control system does not work properly. Cells grow and divide too quickly. Eventually, out-of-control cell division can result in a mass of abnormal cells called a tumor. All of the cells of a tumor are descendants of a single cell that malfunctioned.</p>

<p>What is required for the cell cycle to function properly? Normally, two classes of genes direct the production of proteins that regulate cell growth and division. One class of genes produces proteins called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggrowthf.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggrowthf.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">growth factors</a> that initiate cell division. The other class of genes, known as <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtumorsu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtumorsu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tumor-suppressor genes</a>, produces proteins that stop cell division in particular situations&#151;for example, when cells contain damaged DNA or when cells start to exceed a specific amount of space. Tumor-suppressor genes can even cause such cells to self-destruct.</p>

<p>A single mutation to a single gene involved in regulating the cell cycle does not usually lead to cancer. Rather, cancer develops when several mutations to such genes accumulate (Figure 12-17). For example, the path to cancer often starts with a mutation to a gene that produces growth factors. If the mutation results in producing too much growth factor or increasing growth-factor activity, the gene may have become an <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/goncogen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/goncogen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">oncogene</a> (AHNG kuh jeen)&#151;a cancer-causing gene. Cells with an oncogene become over-stimulated to divide more often than normal. The chances of cancer developing are increased if a mutation to a tumor-suppressor gene also occurs. Without the proteins coded by the tumor-suppressor gene to stop them, the over-stimulated cells may continue dividing out of control. An abnormal ball of cells forms and grows. If further mutations to other tumor-suppressor genes occur, the abnormal cells may grow into a malignant tumor. As you read in Chapter 9, the growth and spread of a malignant tumor harm the body and can eventually be fatal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">"Inherited" Cancer</span><br>
Cancer is always a genetic disease in the sense that it always results from changes in DNA. Most mutations that lead to cancer occur in the organ where the cancer starts. Because these mutations do not affect the cells that give rise to eggs or sperm, they are not passed from parent to child. In some cases, however, a mutation to one or more of these same genes does occur in a cell that gives rise to gametes. Such mutations are passed on and increase the risk of cancer in offspring over the following generations. An example of an inherited cancer gene is a mutated version of a tumor-suppressor gene called <i>BRCA1</i>. Women with this gene are at higher risk for breast cancer. Although women who inherit this mutation will not necessarily develop cancer, their risk is higher because they have an unfortunate "head-start" on accumulating the mutations that lead to cancer.</p>
