<p>DNA can store a vast amount of information in a tiny space. The DNA in just one set of your chromosomes contains 3 billion base pairs. Therefore, in each of your diploid body cells, the nucleus contains 6 billion base pairs. This information provides the instructions for all the parts and processes that have become you.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">DNA Packing in a Single Cell</span><br>
Each of your chromosomes consists of a single DNA molecule. That DNA molecule is thousands of times longer than the diameter of the nucleus that contains it. If you could straighten out all the DNA molecules in a cell's 46 chromosomes and place them end to end, the DNA would stretch for 2 meters!</p>

<p>The complete set of genetic material in an organism, as defined by the order of bases in the DNA, is called its <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggenome.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggenome.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">genome</a> (JEE nohm). The genome can fit into the nucleus of a single cell because of DNA's elaborate packing system (Figure 12-1). First, DNA wraps around small proteins called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghistone.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghistone.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">histones</a>, much as you might tightly wrap a length of thread around a spool. Next the DNA is wrapped into a tight helical fiber, and then coils further into a thick "supercoil." Looping and folding further compacts the DNA in each chromosome.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Human Genome Project </span><br>
Now that you have a sense of the amount of DNA in the human genome, consider the difficulty of trying to determine the sequence of all the nucleotides. Recall from Chapter 11 that each polymer in DNA's double helix is a long chain of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains one of four nitrogenous bases: A, T, G, or C. The order of bases (the sequence) is unique for different species. Even among individuals of the same species, there are small differences in certain regions of the sequence.</p>

<p>By 1990, advances in DNA technology enabled scientists to tackle the challenge of completely sequencing the human genome. The government-funded Human Genome Project began. A rough draft of the entire sequence was completed in 2000. Scientists at private companies have contributed data for this huge project as well.</p>

<p>Knowing the sequence of nucleotides is just one step toward understanding the human genome. Regions of DNA that code for polypeptides (the genes) must be distinguished from non-coding regions. Then, the <i>functions</i> of the resulting polypeptides must be determined. </p>

<p>The DNA sequences determined by the Human Genome Project are entered into a database that is available to researchers all over the world through the Internet. The potential benefits of having a complete map of the human genome are great. Comparing human sequences with those from other species is already providing insight into human embryonic development and evolutionary relationships. For human health, identifying genes will aid in diagnosing, treating, and possibly preventing many common ailments. These include allergies, diabetes, and cancer. Researchers have already identified hundreds of disease-associated genes.</p>
