<p>Meiosis occurs repeatedly in a person's lifetime as the testes produce sperm or the ovaries complete production of eggs. Almost always, the meiotic spindle distributes chromosomes to the daughter cells without error. But occasionally an accident occurs that can have serious consequences.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Down Syndrome</span><br>
In Chapter 9 you read that a normal human karyotype has 46 total chromosomes, or 23 pairs. When a karyotype includes not two, but <i>three</i> number 21 chromosomes, this condition is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtrisomy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtrisomy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">trisomy 21</a> (TRY soh mee). Trisomy 21 results from an error during either stage of meiosis, but most commonly during meiosis I.</p>

<p>In most cases, a human embryo with an abnormal number of chromosomes results in a miscarriage (meaning the embryo does not survive). But many embryos with trisomy chromosome 21 do survive. Trisomy 21 affects about one out of every 700 children born in the United States.</p>

<p>People with trisomy 21 have a general set of symptoms called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gsownsyn.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gsownsyn.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Down syndrome</a>, named after John Langdon Down, who described the syndrome in 1866. These symptoms include certain characteristic facial features and below-average height. Other symptoms typically include heart defects, an impaired immune system, and varying degrees of mental disability. Though people with Down syndrome have lifetimes that are shorter than average, they can live to middle age or beyond and have productive and happy lives. </p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Nonseparation of Chromosomes</span><br>
Trisomy 21 and other errors in chromosome number are usually caused by homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids failing to separate during meiosis, an event called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnondisj.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnondisj.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nondisjunction</a> (nahn dis JUNK shun). Nondisjunction can occur in anaphase of meiosis I or II, resulting in gametes with abnormal numbers of chromosomes (Figure 12-4). Trisomy 21 can occur when a normal sperm fertilizes an egg cell with an extra chromosome 21, resulting in a zygote with 3 copies of chromosome 21 and a total of 47 chromosomes, instead of the usual 46. As a result of mitosis, all the new cells in the developing embryo will also have 47 chromosomes.</p>

<p>What causes nondisjunction to occur? The answer is not fully understood, but it is known that as a woman gets older, she is more likely to have offspring with trisomy 21 (Figure 12-5). This finding suggests a connection to the time line of egg cell development. Meiosis begins in the pre-egg cells in a girl's ovaries before she is born but then pauses until years later. At puberty, meiosis resumes. Usually only one egg resumes meiosis and is released from the ovaries each month until menopause, at about age 50. This means that a cell might remain stopped in the middle of meiosis for decades. It seems that the longer the time lag, the greater the chance that there will be errors such as nondisjunction when meiosis is finally completed. Some researchers hypothesize that damage to the cell during this lag time contributes to errors in meiosis.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Damaged Chromosomes</span><br>
Even if all chromosomes are present in normal numbers in a cell, changes in chromosome structure may also cause disorders. For example, a chromosome may break, leading to a variety of new arrangements that affect its genes (Figure 12-6).</p>

						</table></p>

<p>The first type of change, a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gduplica.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gduplica.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">duplication</a>, occurs when part of a chromosome is repeated. A second type of change, a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdeletio.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdeletio.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">deletion</a>, occurs when a fragment of a chromosome is lost. Remember that losing a fragment of a chromosome means losing part or all of the genes that code for certain proteins. Those proteins have specific functions in the body. Therefore, as you might expect, large deletions tend to have very serious effects on the body. Duplications within certain chromosomes are not always fatal but often result in developmental abnormalities.</p>

<p>Another type of change, an <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginversi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginversi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">inversion</a>, involves reversing a fragment of the original chromosome. Because most of the genes are still present in their normal number, inversions are less likely than deletions or duplications to produce harmful effects. Finally, a translocation occurs when a fragment of one chromosome attaches to a nonhomologous chromosome. Sometimes a <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtranslo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtranslo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">translocation</a> results in two different chromosomes exchanging parts, as shown in the bottom scenario of Figure 12-6.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Jumping Genes</span><br>
Another type of change in chromosomes involves single genes that can move around. This startling discovery was the work of American geneticist Barbara McClintock in the 1940s. While studying genetic variation in corn, she found that certain genetic elements had the unusual ability to move from one location to another in a chromosome. They could even move to an entirely different chromosome. (Note that this is different from a translocation, where a whole piece of the chromosome moves, not just a gene.)</p>

<p>McClintock discovered that these "jumping genes" could land in the middle of other genes and disrupt them. For instance, jumping genes could disrupt pigment genes in corn cells, leading to spotted kernels. McClintock's jumping genes are now called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtranspo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtranspo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">transposons</a>. Current evidence suggests that all organisms, including humans, have transposons. In 1983, McClintock received a Nobel Prize for her pioneering work.</p>

<p>Figure 12-8 shows the simplest kind of transposon and how its movement can interfere with another gene. The transposon includes a gene (shown in green) that codes for an enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes movement of the gene by attaching to the ends of the transposon and another site on the DNA. The enzyme then cuts the DNA and catalyzes insertion of the transposon at the new site, sometimes disrupting another gene (shown in red).</p>
