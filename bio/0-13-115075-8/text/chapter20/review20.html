 <b>c.</b> heartwood.<br>
 <b>d.</b> phloem.</p>
 
<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
  
<p><b>8.</b> Trace what happens to a pollen grain after it lands on another flower's stigma. What results from the two fertilizations?</p>
  
<p><b>9.</b> List four ways that seeds can be dispersed and give an example of each.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Describe three environmental conditions that can trigger germination of certain plants.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Define vegetative reproduction. Explain its advantages in farming and cultivating decorative plants.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Compare and contrast a fibrous root system and a taproot system.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Compare and contrast the organization of vascular tissue in monocot and dicot stems.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>17.</b> Copy and complete the table below that summarizes the functions of plant structures. Add as many additional rows as you can for other structures you learned about in this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Examine the diagrams below and answer the following questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> Which process do both diagrams show?<br>
<b>b.</b> Describe an adaptation shown in each diagram. Explain its effect in aiding the process shown.<br>
<b>c.</b> Name the structures indicated by the labels <i>a,</i> <i>b,</i> and <i>c.</i></p>

<p align="center"><img src="20images/20-cr-18.gif" width="180" height="204" alt="diagram of a process"></p>

<p><b>19. Analyzing Photographs</b> Examine the photograph showing a cross section of a tree trunk.<br>
<b>a.</b> Approximately how old was this tree when it was cut down? 5, 10, 20, or 30 years old?<br>
Match numbers on the photo with the descriptions below and explain your choice. <br>
<b>b.</b> In this year, there was probably a drought.<br>
<b>c.</b> In this year, spring was probably long and wet, and the short  summer was hot.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>20. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Biologists generally define an "animal tissue" as a unit of many similar cells that together perform a specific function. How does this definition of a tissue contrast with what biologists call a "tissue system" in plants?</p>
  
<p><b>21. Relating Cause and Effect</b> If a plant's terminal buds were clipped, would the plant's growth stop? Explain your answer.</p>

<p><b>22. Problem Solving</b> Suppose two trees are damaged by two different bark-eating animals. The first animal eats a ring of bark all the way around the tree. The second animal eats the same amount as the first, but peels off a vertical strip of bark. Do they do the same amount of damage to the tree? Explain.</p>

<p><b>23. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Within the ovaries of a flower, meiosis produces spores that develop into pollen grains.<br>
<b>b.</b> Putting a seed in a warm, moist environment causes germination.<br>
<b>c.</b> Tree trunks are made of dead cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> Plant scientists are searching Peru, Mexico, and the Middle East for the wild ancestors of potatoes, corn, and wheat, respectively. Research one of these crops and include details in your report about the crop's ancestry and the biology and cultivation of the crop today.</p>
