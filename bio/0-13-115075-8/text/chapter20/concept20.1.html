<p>Next time you are around flowers, look carefully inside. Many of the flowers you are familiar with are known for their pretty petals, but there's much more to a flower than petals. In fact, center stage for the plant's reproductive action is tucked inside. Read on to find out how the drama unfolds.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Flowers and Reproduction</span><br>
While flowers come in all different shapes, colors, and sizes, most share the same basic pattern. A flower is a specialized shoot unique to angiosperms that usually consists of four different rings of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (Figure 20-1). The outermost ring, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsepal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsepal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sepals</a>, covers and protects the flower bud before the blossom opens. (An example is a rosebud.) The next ring into the flower is composed of <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpetal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpetal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">petals</a>. Petals are often strikingly colorful&#150;they are probably the structures you think of when you picture a flower. Some flower petals have "runway" markings that help guide insect pollinators toward the flower's reproductive parts. Finally, closest to the center of the flower are the stamens and carpels, the actual reproductive structures. Most flowers have multiple stamens surrounding one or more carpels. Some species, however, have stamens and carpels on separate flowers or even separate plants.</p>

<p>The male gametophytes are produced within the stamens (Figure 20-2). Each stamen consists of a long stalk topped by a sac called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganther.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganther.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">anther</a>. Within the anthers, meiosis produces spores that develop into pollen grains&#151;the male haploid gametophytes. Each pollen grain consists of two cells surrounded by a thick protective wall. When smelling a flower, you may have dusted your nose with some of these tiny pollen grains.</p>

						</table></p>


<p>The female gametophytes are produced in the carpels. At the base of each carpel is an ovary. Inside the ovary are structures called ovules. In each ovule, a diploid cell undergoes meiosis and forms four haploid spores. Three of the four haploid cells die. The surviving haploid cell enlarges and undergoes three cycles of mitosis. The resulting structure is the female gametophyte, called the embryo sac. Among the seven cells making up the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gembryos.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gembryos.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">embryo sac</a>, one is an egg cell and one is a large, central cell containing two haploid nuclei. Leading to the ovary is a narrow structure called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstyle.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstyle.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">style</a>, which has a sticky tip called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstigma.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstigma.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stigma</a> (plural, <i>stigmata</i>).</p>

<p>What roles do these structures play in the sexual reproduction of angiosperms? During <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpollina.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpollina.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pollination</a>, pollen grains released from anthers land on the stigmata of flowers of the same species. Typically, this is after the pollen has been carried by wind or an animal to another flower. Once on a stigma, a pollen grain absorbs water and extends a structure called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolltub.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolltub.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pollen tube</a>. The pollen tube grows toward the ovary through the style. Meanwhile, one of the pollen's cells divides once, forming two haploid sperm. When the pollen tube reaches the ovule in the ovary, it enters the embryo sac and releases both sperm cells.
Next, <i>two</i> fertilizations take place. One sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell and forms a zygote. The zygote develops into the sporophyte embryo. The other sperm cell fertilizes the large central cell with the two haploid nuclei, resulting in a <i>triploid</i> cell (3<i>n</i>). This triploid cell develops into a nutrient-rich tissue called endosperm that nourishes the growing embryo.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Seed Development and Dispersal</span><br>
After the double fertilization takes place, the ovule develops into a seed. Seeds have a tough outer layer called a seed coat that helps to protect the tiny embryo and endosperm inside. A miniature root and shoot take form. A structure called the cotyledon also develops. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcotyled.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcotyled.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cotyledon</a> (kaht uh LEE dun) functions in the storage and transfer of nutrients to the embryo. In dicots (short for <i>dicotyledon</i>), there are two (<i>di</i>) cotyledons. In monocots, there is one (<i>mono</i>) cotyledon.</p>

<p>After several cycles of mitosis, the growth and development of the plant embryo within the seed is temporarily suspended. This is the stage when the seed can be dispersed from the parent plant. As you learned in Chapter 19, a fruit develops from the ovary of an angiosperm. Fruits protect seeds and help disperse seeds from the parent plant.</p>

<p>Seed dispersal can occur in many ways. Some seeds travel by sticking onto a passing animal's fur, as with burrs. (A burr is actually a fruit, just not a tasty one!) Other seeds are tucked inside fleshy, edible fruits that are attractive to animals as food. The flesh of the fruit gets digested, but the indigestible seed coat protects the embryo. The seed passes through the animal's digestive tract and is eventually deposited as part of the animal's feces, sometimes many kilometers from the original plant. Some seeds, such as coconuts, travel on water (again, encased in the fruit). Others are so tiny and lightweight that they can be carried by the wind. A dandelion is one example of a plant whose seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Seed Germination</span><br>
When conditions are favorable, the plant embryo begins to grow again. This process is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggermina.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggermina.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">germination</a>. Most seeds must soak up water in order to germinate. By taking up water, the seed expands and splits its seed coat. The water also triggers metabolic changes in the embryo that enable it to grow.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Adaptations</span> After breaking out of the seed coat, the journey of a plant shoot through the soil to the surface is a difficult one. Have you ever scraped your knee or elbow on gravel? In a similar way, but on a smaller scale, sand and other hard particles in soil are abrasive to new plant tissues sliding past them. But plants have adaptations that protect the developing shoot as it grows toward the surface (Figure 20-5). For example, some dicots have a hooked shoot tip. This protects the delicate shoot tip by holding it downward as the shoot moves through the soil. As the shoot breaks through the soil surface, its tip is lifted gently out of the soil and straightens out. In most monocots, a sheath surrounding the shoot pushes straight upward, breaking through the soil. The delicate shoot then grows upward through this protective tunnel. After emerging into the light, the first leaves expand from the shoot and begin making food by photosynthesis. At this stage the young plant is called a <i>seedling.</i></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Environmental Conditions</span> What environmental conditions are required for germination? If you've ever tried to grow garden vegetables, you probably noticed that simply exposing the seeds to a warm, moist environment was enough in most cases. But the conditions for germination vary among plant species. Some plants have more particular requirements. For example, some desert plants germinate only after a heavy rainfall. This allows the seedling to push more easily through the moistened soil, and ensures at least a temporary water supply that can be used by its growing tissues. In climates with harsh winters, some seeds will germinate only after being exposed to a long period of cold. This prevents them from germinating in the middle of winter. Some seeds require exposure to the intense heat of a brush fire before germinating. The fire clears dense shrubs and other growth that would otherwise totally shade the seedling.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Asexual Reproduction in Plants</span><br>
There are several obstacles to successful sexual reproduction in plants. Pollen may not reach the stigma of the correct species of flower. Seeds may get damaged during the dispersal process, or they may end up somewhere they cannot germinate. Furthermore, only a small fraction of seedlings in the wild actually survive to mature into plants capable of making their own seeds. Delicate seedlings may perish from lack of water or be eaten. But, in addition to sexual reproduction, many plants are also capable of asexual reproduction.</p>

<p>Asexual reproduction in plants is called vegetative reproduction. The offspring, or clones, are genetically identical to the original plant. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvegetat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvegetat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vegetative reproduction</a> can occur naturally or with human help. Some plants, such as many cacti, drop stems or other shoots that establish new roots and become clones. Other plants, such as strawberry plants and many grasses, send out runners. Some trees and shrubs send out shoots from the base of their trunks or from underground stems. These clones often persist after the original plant dies. Using vegetative reproduction in agriculture and horticulture provides a way to propagate useful crop specimens or decorative plants without needing to wait for seeds produced by the desired plant to develop. Vegetative reproduction also offers the advantage of duplicating desired traits exactly, without sexual recombination of traits.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Long Does a Plant Live?</span><br>
For plants that mainly reproduce sexually, life expectancies vary. Plants called <i>annuals</i> complete their life cycle (germinate, grow, produce flowers and seeds, and die) in a single year's growing season (for example, from spring to fall). <i>Biennials</i> complete their life cycle in two years and usually only flower the second year. <i>Perennials</i> live and reproduce for multiple years.</p>
