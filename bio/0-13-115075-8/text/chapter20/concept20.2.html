<p>Like animals, plants have specialized organs, tissues, and cells. These structural adaptations enhance the survival and reproductive success of plants in the environments in which they grow.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Plant's Root System and Shoot System</span><br>
Roots anchor a plant in the soil and provide structural support. From the soil, roots absorb minerals and water. Most monocots have fibrous root systems. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfibrous.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfibrous.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fibrous root</a> system consists of a mat of thin roots spread out below the soil surface, providing increased exposure to soil nutrients and water. In contrast, most dicots have a <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtaproot.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtaproot.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">taproot</a> system that is characterized by one large vertical root with many smaller branches. Carrots, turnips, and beets are examples of dicots that have very large, starch-storing taproots.</p>

<p>The shoot system of an angiosperm consists of stems, leaves, and flowers (Figure 20-8). <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstem.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstem.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Stems</a> are parts of a plant that support leaves and flowers. Nodes are the points on the stem at which leaves are attached, and internodes are the portions of the stem between nodes. Stems play an important role in transporting materials in a plant. Vascular tissue runs vertically in the stem, transporting water and minerals from the roots up to the leaves, and food from the leaves down through the stem to the roots. Stems may also conduct some photosynthesis and store nutrients.</p>

						</table></p>


<p>Undeveloped shoots are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbud.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbud.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">buds</a>. A terminal bud is found at the tip of a stem. Axillary buds are found in the angles (the axils) formed by a leaf and the main stem. Growth from axillary buds forms the plant's branches.</p>

<p>Leaves are the primary food-manufacturing sites of a plant. As you read in Chapter 8, leaves capture sunlight and convert light energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis. Most leaves are flattened and thin. The main part of the leaf is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gblade.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gblade.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">blade</a>. A stalk called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpetiole.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpetiole.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">petiole</a> (PET ee ohl) connects the leaf to the stem. Running through the petiole and into the blade are leaf veins. The veins carry water and nutrients and consist of vascular tissue and support tissue.</p>

<p>Some plants have highly modified leaves. For example, the long leaves of grasses lack petioles altogether. Celery, on the other hand, has enormous petioles&#151;the "stalks" that you eat. Some leaves, such as the spines on a cactus, are modified so much they hardly resemble a typical leaf. The tendrils on a pea plant or a grapevine are modified leaves that allow a plant to attach to and climb along a surface.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Plant's Main Tissue Systems</span><br>
A plant has three main tissue systems: the dermal, vascular, and ground tissue systems. (A fourth kind of tissue called meristematic tissue continually produces the cells that will differentiate into these other three tissue types. It will be discussed in Concept 20.3.) The three main tissue systems change as a plant ages. Here you will read about the three tissue systems as they occur in young, nonwoody parts of a plant (Figure 20-10).</p>

						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Dermal Tissue</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdermalt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdermalt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dermal tissue</a> is the outer covering or "skin" of the plant. Epidermis, the dermal tissue of nonwoody organs such as young roots, consists of one or more layers of cells. Epidermis covers and protects all the young parts of the plant. Some epidermis is specialized. For example, leaf epidermis secretes a waxy cuticle. Recall from Concept 19.1 that the cuticle is an adaptation that helps plants retain water.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Vascular Tissue</span> One of the key adaptations of plants that you read about in Chapter 19 is vascular tissue. <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvasctis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvasctis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Vascular tissue</a> transports water, mineral nutrients, and organic molecules between the roots and shoots. Vascular tissue also contributes to the structural support of the plant. There are two types of vascular tissue. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/x/gxylem.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/x/gxylem.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">xylem</a> (ZY lum) transports water and dissolved minerals upward from roots into shoots. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphloem.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphloem.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phloem</a> (FLOH um) transports food made in mature leaves to the roots and parts of the shoot system that don't photosynthesize, such as developing leaves and fruits.</p>

<p>Vascular tissue is located in the centers of roots, but in the stems it is arranged in many separate strands called vascular bundles. The monocot stem has vascular bundles scattered throughout its ground tissue, whereas the vascular bundles of the dicot stem are arranged in a ring. You'll read more about the structure and function of vascular tissue in Chapter 21.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ground Tissue</span> Filling the spaces between the dermal and vascular tissues, <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggroundt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggroundt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ground tissue</a> makes up most of a young, nonwoody plant and functions in photosynthesis (in the shoot), storage, and support throughout the plant. The ground tissue of the root consists primarily of a mass of cells called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcortex.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcortex.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cortex</a>. You will read more about the root cortex in Concept 20.3.</p>


<p><span class="setextsub">Types of Plant Cells</span><br>
The plant tissues you've been reading about are made up of three basic cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma. The most abundant type of cell, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gparench.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gparench.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">parenchyma cell</a> (puh RENG kih muh), has thin cell walls and typically, large central vacuoles. These cells perform a variety of functions in the plant, including food storage, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration. Fruits are made up mostly of parenchyma cells. The food-conducting cells of phloem are also parenchyma cells.</p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcollenc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcollenc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Collenchyma cells</a> (kuh LENG kih muh) have unevenly thickened cell walls. Grouped in strands or cylinders, collenchyma cells provide support in parts of the plant that are still growing. Young stems and petioles often have collenchyma just below their surface (the "strings" of a celery stalk for example). These living cells elongate with the stems and leaves they support as these regions grow. </p>

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gscleren.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gscleren.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Sclerenchyma cells</a> (sklih RENG kih muh) are specialized for support. Sclerenchyma cells grow and then die within a mature part of a plant. But that doesn't mean they become useless to the plant after dying. Their lignin-rich cell walls are left behind, creating the "skeleton" that supports the plant. For example, the water-conducting cells of xylem are specialized sclerenchyma cells.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a particular type of plant tissue is not made up of just one type of plant cell. For example, ground tissue, while mostly parenchyma, may also have collenchyma (as in a celery stalk) and even sclerenchyma (as in the gritty spots of a pear's otherwise soft parenchyma).</p>
