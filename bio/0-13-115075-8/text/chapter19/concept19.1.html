<p>What is a plant? You might say that you know one when you see one. But plants include an enormous range of very diverse organisms, from mosses to ferns to wildflowers to pine trees. Plants are multicellular, usually photosynthetic, mostly land-dwelling organisms that are very different from their green algae ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Origin of Plants from Algae</span><br>
Based on molecular, cellular, and anatomical comparisons, the closest modern relatives of the ancestors of plants are the multicellular green algae called charophytes. Many species of modern charophytes (KAYR oh fyts) are found in shallow fresh water around the edges of ponds and lakes. Biologists hypothesize that some ancient charophytes may have lived in  similar shallow-water habitats that occasionally dried out. Natural selection would have favored individual algae that could survive these dry periods.</p> 

<p>Adaptations enabling permanent life on dry land apparently accumulated by about 475 million years ago, the age of the oldest plant fossils. Modern plants diversified from those early descendants of green algae. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplant.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplant.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plant</a> is a multicellular autotroph in which the embryo develops within the female parent.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Challenges of Life on Land</span><br>
Most of the differences between plants and charophytes are related to the plants' adaptations to life on land. There are four major challenges to plants living on land: obtaining resources, staying upright, maintaining moisture, and reproducing.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Obtaining Resources From Two Places at Once</span>  Algae and other aquatic organisms acquire the resources they need from the surrounding water. In contrast, the resources required by a photosynthetic organism growing on land are found in two very different environments: air and soil. Light and carbon dioxide are mainly available above ground, while water and mineral nutrients are found mainly in the soil. The bodies of most plants have specialized organ systems&#151;shoots and roots&#151;that provide access to these two environments (Figure 19-2).</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Below ground, a plant's roots absorb water and essential minerals from the soil. Above ground, shoots bear leaves. Leaves use sunlight as an energy source to make food from carbon dioxide, as you learned in Chapter 8. Most plants transport materials between their roots and shoots within <a href="../../glossary/terms/v/gvasctis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/v/gvasctis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">vascular tissue</a>, a system of tube-shaped cells that branches throughout the plant.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Staying "Afloat" in Air</span> If you have seen kelp or other seaweeds washed up on the beach, you know that these large algae are limp and flexible, yet they stay upright in water. In an aquatic environment, the buoyancy of water provides physical support for large algae.</p> 

<p>Air does not provide the same level of support as water. Plants can only stand upright because they contain strong and rigid support tissues. An important terrestrial adaptation of plants is the production of <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glignin.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glignin.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lignin</a>, a chemical that hardens the plants' cell walls. A tree would collapse if it were not for its framework of lignin-rich cell walls.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Maintaining Moisture</span> Though most plants are exposed to dry air, their cellular processes must still take place in an aqueous environment. Plants (and other terrestrial organisms) have adaptations that maintain a watery internal environment. The waxy surfaces of a cactus or an apple are examples of such an adaptation. This waxy <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gtcuticle.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcuticle.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cuticle</a> coats the leaves and other aboveground parts of many plants, helping the plant body retain water. However, the cuticle also slows down the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the surrounding air and the inside of photosynthesizing leaves. Gases are exchanged through stomata (singular, <i>stoma</i>). <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstoma.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstoma.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Stomata</a> (STOH ma ta) are microscopic pores in the leaf's surface. Two surrounding cells regulate each stoma's opening and closing. Stomata are open at certain times of day, allowing gas exchange, and are closed the rest of the time, preventing water loss by evaporation.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Reproducing on Land</span> Living on land also requires reproductive adaptations. For algae, the surrounding water ensures that released gametes (sperm and eggs) and developing offspring do not dry out. The aquatic environment also provides a means of dispersing the gametes and offspring to new locations. Plants, however, must keep their gametes and developing offspring from drying out in the air. Plants must also have some means for dispersal other than water currents.</p>

<p>Several adaptations of plants meet these challenges. All plants produce their gametes in a "jacket" of protective cells. The protective jacket surrounds a moist chamber where gametes can develop without dehydrating. In most plants, sperm reach the eggs by traveling within pollen grains, which are carried by wind or animals. Eggs remain within the tissues of the female parent and are fertilized there. The zygote (fertilized egg) develops into an embryo while still inside the female parent (Figure 19-4). For most plants, the embryos are eventually dispersed as seeds, enclosed in protective coats.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">An Overview of Plant Diversity</span><br>
The fossil record provides evidence of four major periods of plant evolution (Figure 19-5). During each period, the evolution of new structures opened up new opportunities and new habitats for plants on land.</p>


					<p align="center"><table width="360" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="19images/19-05.gif" width="360" height="474" ALT="Figure 19-5"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 19-5<br>Fossil evidence indicates that bryophytes are the oldest and angiosperms the youngest of the four major plant groups.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>The first period of plant evolution was marked by the origin of plants from charophytes, their aquatic algal ancestors. The first group to diversify from the charophytes were the bryophytes. This group includes the mosses and their relatives. Bryophytes (BRY oh fyts) do not have seeds, and most species lack lignin-hardened vascular tissue.</p> 

<p>The second period of plant evolution was marked by the development of plants with lignin-hardened vascular tissues that transport water and nutrients.  Early vascular plants lacked seeds. Today, one group of vascular plants called pteridophytes (teh RID oh fyts), including ferns, still have no seeds.</p> 

<p>The third major period of plant evolution began with the origin of the seed. A seed consists of an embryo packaged along with a store of food within a protective coat. Seeds contributed to the spread of plants to diverse habitats on land by allowing plant embryos to be dispersed without drying out. Early seed plants gave rise to many types of gymnosperms (JIM noh spurmz). Gymnosperms (Greek for "naked seed") have seeds that develop "naked" (without being enclosed within a chamber) on specialized leaves of the parent plant. Today, the most widespread and diverse gymnosperms are the conifers&#151;cone-bearing trees such as pines.</p>

<p>The fourth major period of plant evolution began with the appearance of flowering plants, or angiosperms (AN jee oh spurmz). The flower is a complex reproductive structure that bears seeds within protective organs called <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/govary.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/govary.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ovaries</a> (see Figure 19-4). This contrasts with the gymnosperms' naked seeds. Most modern-day plants are angiosperms, including roses, lilies, and daffodils, as well as many species with less obvious flowers, such as grasses and oak trees.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Alternation of Generations</span><br>
Plant generations alternate between diploid (<i>2n</i>) and haploid (<i>n</i>) forms (Figure 19-6). Recall from Chapter 9 that diploids have two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. Haploids have just one set as a result of meiosis. In the life cycles of plants, the haploid and the diploid forms are distinct, multicellular generations. In some plants, the haploid individual is actually larger than the diploid one. In contrast, animals such as humans have a unicellular haploid stage, which is a single sperm or egg cell, as you learned in Chapter 9.</p>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 19-6<br>A plant's life cycle alternates between the gametophyte and sporophyte generations.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>The haploid generation of plants produces gametes and is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggametop.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggametop.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gametophyte</a> (guh MEET uh fyt). The diploid generation produces spores and is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsporoph.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsporoph.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sporophyte</a> (SPOH ruh fyt). In a plant's life cycle, each of these generations "takes turns" giving rise to the other. The alternation between the haploid and diploid forms is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/galterna.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/galterna.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">alternation of generations</a>.</p> 

<p>As reproductive cells, spores differ from gametes in two ways. First, a spore can develop into a new organism without fusing with another cell. In contrast, two gametes must fuse to form a zygote. Second, spores of some plants have tough coats that enable them to resist harsh environments. Gametes are not adapted to resist harsh conditions.</p> 

<p>An alternation of generations occurs only in the life cycles of plants and certain algae. Throughout this chapter, you will read about the specific pattern of alternation of generations found in each of the four major groups of modern plants: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms.</p>
