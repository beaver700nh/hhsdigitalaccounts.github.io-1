<p>During the Carboniferous period, from 363 to 290 million years ago, vast swampy forests covered much of what is now Eurasia and North America. These forests were dominated by large, seedless vascular plants. Today the descendants of these giants are still an important part of many plant communities.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Pteridophyte Adaptations</span><br>
In contrast to the bryophytes, ferns and other <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpterido.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpterido.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pteridophytes</a> have lignin-hardened support tissues, which include the water-conducting cells of vascular tissue. The pteridophytes and other vascular plants also have vascular tissue specialized for tranporting sugar. These adaptations probably enabled pteridophytes to dominate the forests of the Carboniferous period.</p>

<p>The remains of these ancient forests have great significance. Under certain conditions of heat and pressure, the organic compounds in their remains formed oil, coal, and natural gas, together referred to as "fossil fuels." Fossil fuels are a major source of energy used to power vehicles and generate electricity.</p>

In contrast to mosses, the sporophyte is the dominant fern generation (Figure 19-10). Perhaps you have observed what look like brown dots on the undersides of mature fern fronds (leaves). In fact, each "dot" is made up of many spore capsules&#151;small spore-filled containers. Each capsule releases a large number of tiny haploid spores that drift down to the ground and grow into tiny gametophytes on or just below the soil surface.</p>

<p>On the underside of the gametophyte are sperm- and egg-producing structures. Pteridophyte sperm, like those of byrophytes, are flagellated. They must swim through a film of water to fertilize eggs. The zygote grows into the new sporophyte.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">The Diversity of Pteridophytes</span><br> 
Perhaps you have seen ferns in the woods. But not all pteridophytes have the graceful leafy fronds of the familiar fern. Some pteridophytes look like little pine trees, and others like green sticks. The following examines characteristics of ferns and some of their lesser-known relatives.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ferns</span> The most diverse and widespread of the pteridophytes are the ferns, with more than 12,000 species. Most ferns have large leaves called fronds and thrive in shady forests. However, certain ferns are adapted to dry environments, such as deserts.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Club "Mosses"</span> Although this plant's common name is the "club moss," and it looks like a little pine tree, it is neither a moss nor a pine. Like other pteridophytes, it has vascular tissue but no seeds. Club mosses are common on the forest floors of the northeastern United States. Giant species of club mosses, now extinct, grew up to 40 meters tall during the Carboniferous period.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Horsetails</span> Horsetails generally grow in marshy, sandy areas. During the Carboniferous period some grew as tall as 15 meters. Their outer layer of cells is embedded with silica, which gives the plant a gritty texture. Before the modern scouring pad was invented, people used the abrasive stems of horsetails to scrub pots and pans. For this reason these plants are also known as "scouring rushes."</p>
