<p>As you have read, some fungi are used to make bread and cheese. You may have eaten certain fungi in their natural forms, too. Other fungi have less positive effects on humans. For example, if you have ever suffered from athlete's foot, you are familiar with an annoying fungus. In fact, fungi cause many diseases in animal and plant species. But whether their effect is delicious or damaging, fungi play improtant roles in ecosystems.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Symbiotic Fungi</span><br>
Throughout this unit you have read about many examples of symbiosis, a close relationship between two different species that benefits at least one of them. Recall that mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both organisms benefit. Fungi participate in a number of important mutualistic relationships.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Lichens</span> A <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glichen.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glichen.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lichen</a> is a mutualistic pairing of a fungus and an alga. Lichens are striking examples of how two species can become so merged that the result is essentially a new life form. At a distance, it is easy to mistake lichens growing on rocks, rotting logs, trees, or roofs for mosses. But a lichen actually consists of millions of tiny algal cells within a mesh of fungal hyphae (Figure 18-12). The photosynthetic algae feed the fungus. The fungal mycelium, in turn, provides a suitable habitat for the algae, helping to absorb and retain water and minerals. The fungal component of lichens is usually a sac fungus, though there are several club fungus lichens. The photosynthetic partners are usually green algae or cyanobacteria. The partnership is so complete that biologists have actually described and named more than 25,000 "species" of lichens, as though they are individual organisms. </p>

<p>One benefit of symbiosis is that lichens are able to live in environments where neither fungi nor algae could live alone. Lichens are important pioneer organisms on newly cleared rock and soil surfaces, such as burned forests and volcanic flows. Additionally, in the arctic tundra, caribou graze on lichens at times of the year when other foods are unavailable.</p>

<p>As tough as lichens are, however, many do not tolerate air pollution. Their absorption of minerals from rain and moist air makes them particularly sensitive to chemicals such as sulfur dioxide. The death of sensitive lichens in an area can be an early warning of poor air quality.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mycorrhizae</span> The evolution of fungi also led to important symbiotic relationships with most land plants. <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmycorrh.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmycorrh.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Mycorrhizae</a> are symbiotic relationships between fungal hyphae and plant roots. The fungi absorb water and essential minerals from the soil and provide these materials to the plant. The fungal mycelium greatly increases the surface area of the root in contact with the soil, which increases the plant's absorption of water and minerals. The sugars produced by the plant, in turn, nourish the fungi.</p>

<p>The importance of mycorrhizae is evident in the number of plants that have them and from the fact that they are found on some of the oldest plant fossils. Almost all plants have mycorrhizae. Nearly half of all mushroom-forming club fungi live as mycorrhizae with oak, birch, and pine trees. The mushrooms you see around the bases of these trees are the surface evidence of the underground symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Disease-causing Fungi</span><br>
Of the 100,000 known species of fungi about 30 percent are parasites, mostly on or in plants. In some cases, fungi that infect plants have literally changed landscapes. One species, for example, causes Dutch elm disease, which has eliminated most elm trees in North America. The fungus was imported from Europe where it caused a minor disease in European elms. The fungus was accidentally introduced into the United States on logs sent from Europe after World War I. American elms had not evolved with this fungus and had no resistance to it. Fungi are also serious agricultural pests. Some species infect grain crops, ruining the harvest or causing disease in people who eat the infected grain.</p>

<p>Animals are much less susceptible to parasitic fungi than are plants. Only about 50 species of fungus are known to be parasitic in humans and other animals. Among these are yeast infections of the lungs, some of which can be fatal. Other fungal parasites produce a skin disease called ringworm, so named because it appears as circular red areas on the skin. Most commonly, these fungi attack the feet and cause intense itching and sometimes blisters. This condition, known as athlete's foot, is highly contagious, but it can be treated with various fungicides. Fungicides are substances that kill fungi without seriously harming the host organism.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Commercial Uses of Fungi</span><br>
Focusing only on disease-causing fungi would give an unfair picture of the kingdom. There are many practical uses for fungi. In addition to edible mushrooms, other edible fungi include truffles. These fungi grow underground as the reproductive structures of sac fungus mycorrhizae. In nature, truffles release strong odors that attract mammals and insects that dig up the fungi and disperse their spores. Truffle hunters take advantage of those odors and use pigs or dogs to locate their prizes. However, since truffles cost hundreds of dollars per kilogram, you probably won't get a chance to do a taste test in the 
school cafeteria.</p>

<p>The distinctive flavors of certain kinds of cheeses come from the fungi used to "ripen" them. As mentioned earlier, yeasts are particularly important in baking, brewing, and winemaking. And a number of antibiotics also come from fungi.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Role of Fungi in Chemical Cycling</span><br>
Fungi and bacteria are the principal decomposers that supply ecosystems with the nutrients essential for plant growth. Without decomposers, elements such as carbon and nitrogen would accumulate in organic matter. Plants and the animals they feed would starve because elements taken from the soil would not be returned.</p>

<p>From the human perspective, there is also a destructive side to fungi. Fungi destroy 10-50 percent of the world's fruit harvest each year. Similarly, a wood-digesting fungus does not distinguish between a fallen oak limb and the oak planks of a boat. During the Revolutionary War, the British lost more ships to fungal rot than to enemy attack. Soldiers in the tropics during World War II watched as their tents, clothing, boots, and even the glue that holds binocular lenses in place were destroyed by molds. Some fungi can even decompose plastic.</p>

<p>Fungi are well adapted as decomposers. Their hyphae invade the tissues and cells of nonliving organic matter and break down complex molecules such as cellulose. Fungi, in concert with bacteria and some animals, are responsible for the complete breakdown of organic material. The air is so loaded with fungal spores that as soon as a leaf falls or an insect dies, it is covered with spores that quickly grow into fungal hyphae.</p>
