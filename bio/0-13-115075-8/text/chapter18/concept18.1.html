<p>Seeing fungi growing on wet leaves or on a fallen log, you might assume they are some type of plant. But based on cell structure, molecular comparisons, reproduction, and modes of nutrition, fungi are not closely related to plants. They are assigned their own kingdom. In fact, DNA comparisons show that fungi are more closely related to you than they are to plants!</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Structure and Function of Fungi</span><br>
Fungi have body structures and modes of reproduction unlike those of any other eukaryotic organisms. The bodies of most fungi are made of structures called hyphae (singular, <i>hypha</i>). <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghypha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghypha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Hyphae</a> are tiny threads of cytoplasm surrounded by a plasma membrane and covered by a cell wall (Figure 18-1). The cell walls of fungi differ from the cellulose cell walls of plants. Most fungi build their cell walls out of chitin, a strong, flexible polysaccharide that is also found in the external skeletons of insects.</p>

<p>The hyphae of most fungi have additional cell walls, called cross-walls, that divide the long filaments into many separate end-to-end cells. This makes most fungi multicellular. The cross-walls of many fungi have pores large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria, and even nuclei to flow from cell to cell. The movement of cytoplasm from one cell to another helps a fungus distribute nutrients from one part of its body to another.</p>

<p>The hyphae of a single fungus typically branch as they grow, forming an interwoven mat called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmyceliu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmyceliu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">mycelium</a> (plural, <i>mycelia</i>). The mycelium functions as the feeding structure of a fungus. Its fibrous structure maximizes contact with the food source. Fungi cannot run, swim, or fly in search of food. But the mycelium makes up for the fungus's lack of mobility by its ability to grow rapidly throughout a food source. A fungal mycelium can grow as much as a kilometer of hyphae each day as it branches within its food.</p>

<p>Mycelia can be huge. Scientists have discovered one enormous mycelium in Oregon that measures 5.5 kilometers across and spreads through almost 9 square kilometers of forest (larger than 1,600 football fields). Scientists also estimate that this fungus is at least 2,400 years old, qualifying it as one of Earth's oldest and largest living organisms.</p>

<p>A mycelium is an efficient structure for the heterotrophic lifestyle of fungi. The branching mycelium enables the fungus to obtain food by <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gabsornu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gabsornu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">absorptive nutrition</a>, a method by which the fungus absorbs small organic molecules from its surroundings. First, the fungus digests food outside its mycelium by secreting powerful enzymes into its surroundings. These enzymes break down complex molecules into smaller molecules the mycelium can absorb.</p>

<p>The more than 100,000 known species of fungi have a great diversity of size, shape, and color. Many fungi play an important role as decomposers. Like some of the bacteria you read about in Chapter 16, fungi recycle nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon by breaking down organic material. Common food sources for fungi are fallen logs, bodies of dead animals, or the wastes of living organisms. In contrast, some species of fungi are parasites. These parasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells or body fluids of living hosts. Parasitic fungi cause about 80 percent of all plant diseases.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Reproduction of Fungi</span><br>
Fungi reproduce by releasing large numbers of microscopic spores. <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gspore.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gspore.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Spores</a> are haploid single cells with thick cell walls that function as the dispersal stage in the reproduction of fungi. These tough reproductive cells are spread by the wind and can withstand unfavorable conditions for long periods of time. When conditions are favorable again, they can germinate and grow into new fungi. Most fungi produce spores asexually by mitosis at the tips of specialized hyphae. In these situations, the spores are haploid because the hyphae from which they come are haploid. Many fungi also produce spores sexually. Haploid hyphae from different mycelia fuse together and combine their genetic material. Eventually, diploid cells resulting from these pairings undergo meiosis. These meiotic divisions produce haploid spores. </p>

<p>One fungus can produce a mind-boggling output of spores. For example, puffballs, which are the reproductive structures of certain fungi, can puff out clouds containing trillions of spores. Spores can be transported easily over great distances by wind or water, which accounts for the wide geographic distribution of many species of fungi. The airborne spores of fungi have been found more than 200 kilometers above Earth's surface. Spores that land in environments where there is moisture and food can absorb water and nutrients and produce a new mycelium.</p>
