<p>Throughout this unit you have explored the complexity and interconnectedness of ecosystems. Over the past few centuries, many ecosystems have been affected by the rapidly growing human population's need for resources. The effects of human activities are sometimes felt in only a small area. Sometimes, though, the ecological impact is more widespread or even global.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Impact on Chemical Cycles</span><br>
Human activities can affect chemical cycling by literally moving nutrients from one place to another. In contrast to a deer, which might eat plants in a forest and return the raw materials to the same forest in its waste, a human might eat a salad containing vegetables from many different parts of the country. And the human's waste might be carried out into the ocean in sewage, far from the sources of the raw nutrients. On an even larger scale, some human activities can disrupt the processes within global chemical cycles. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Carbon Cycle Impacts</span> As you have read, the burning of wood and fossil fuels is one source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As nations have become more industrialized, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen steadily (Figure 36-13). <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdefores.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdefores.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Deforestation</a>, the clearing of forests for agriculture, lumber, and other uses, also affects the carbon cycle by eliminating plants that absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Sometimes after being cut down, the trees are then burned, releasing more carbon dioxide. Burning after deforestation in the tropics accounts for about 20 percent of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by human activities. Worldwide burning of fossil fuels accounts for most of the other 80 percent.</p>

<p>How are increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere significant? Carbon dioxide is one of a few gases in the atmosphere that allow sunlight to pass through to Earth, but trap some heat as it is reflected and radiated from Earth's surface (Figure 36-14). As a result, the temperature of Earth's surface is higher than it would be if all heat escaped into space. These gases act somewhat like the glass windows of a greenhouse that allow light in, but prevent heat from escaping. Because of this analogy, the process by which atmospheric gases trap heat is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggreenho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggreenho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">greenhouse effect</a>. As the levels of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" rise, the greenhouse effect becomes stronger, trapping more heat in the atmosphere and raising Earth's average temperature. Such an overall rise in Earth's average temperature is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gglobalw.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gglobalw.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">global warming</a>.</p>

<p>Using a variety of computer models, scientists make predictions about the long-term effects of increasing carbon dioxide levels. Global warming predictions range from just tenths of a degree to a few degrees Celsius. Scientists also have different hypotheses about the possible effects of global warming. For example, a few degrees of warming could cause enough melting of glaciers and polar ice caps to cause a rise in sea levels, flooding low-lying coastal areas. Small changes in temperatures could also have large effects on weather, such as changing precipitation patterns. The boundaries between biomes might shift, affecting the species that live in them. Which species could move or adapt quickly enough to survive these changes? The answer is unknown.</p>

<p>International cooperation and individual actions are all needed to lessen the chance of these outcomes. Nations can identify ways that people in the tropics can support themselves without burning forests. Nations can also reduce use of fossil fuels by conserving energy and developing alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy. You can help by making your home more energy-efficient and by walking, biking, or riding public transportation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Nitrogen Cycle Impacts</span> Human activities impact the nitrogen cycle primarily by moving large amounts of nitrogen compounds into the water or the air. For example, some sewage treatment plants release dissolved nitrogen compounds into streams and rivers. Fertilizers applied to crops are another source of nitrogen compounds&#151;excess fertilizer may run off into nearby streams and ponds. The high levels of nitrogen, often along with phosphates, feed the rapid growth of algae in these bodies of water, a condition called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/geutroph.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/geutroph.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">eutrophication</a>. As the algae die, the bacteria decomposing them can use up so much of the oxygen in the water that there is no longer enough to support other organisms.</p>

<p>Smokestacks and automobile exhaust pipes release certain nitrogen and sulfur compounds into the atmosphere. There these compounds combine with water, forming nitric and sulfuric acids. Precipitation that carries this acid back to Earth's surface is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gacidrai.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gacidrai.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">acid rain</a>. The Clean Air Act has helped lessen the acid rain problem in the United States by reducing levels of sulfuric acids. However, precipitation in some areas is still acidic enough to cause damage. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Water Cycle Impacts</span> One human activity that can impact the water cycle is deforestation. A primary way that fresh water returns to the atmosphere is transpiration from dense tropical forests. As a result, tropical deforestation greatly reduces the amount of water vapor added to the atmosphere. This changes precipitation patterns and affects ecosystems. Drawing water from rivers or underground aquifers for household use or crop irrigation also affects the water cycle. If the rate of water use is faster than the rate at which the water cycle can replace it, the river or aquifer may eventually run dry.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Case Study: Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest</span> About 40 years ago, scientists started a long-term study on the effects of deforestation on chemical cycling in a New Hampshire forest. The study measured chemical cycling in an area of the forest where all the trees were cut down (the altered area) compared to an untouched area (the reference area). Scientists recorded nutrient levels in streams flowing out of each area. For several years following the cut, the water volume flowing from the altered area increased by 30 to 40 percent. Without trees to absorb excess water, the water ran off from the soil. Most remarkable was the loss of nitrate along with the water, which increased 60-fold (or 6000 percent) in concentration in the stream flowing from the altered area (Figure 36-16). However, as new plants grew in the treatment area, transpiration increased and runoff decreased. The Hubbard Brook research shows that plants play a large role in chemical cycling in a forest ecosystem. In Online Activity 36.4, you can use a virtual laboratory to collect and analyze water and soil samples in the Hubbard Brook Forest.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Other Effects of Pollution</span><br>
The addition of substances to the environment that result in a negative effect is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpolluti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpolluti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pollution</a>. You have just read how pollution can affect chemical cycles. Two more examples show how pollution can affect food chains and Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Biological Magnification</span> As organisms take in nutrients and water from the environment, they may also take in pollutants. Though some pollutants may be excreted, others accumulate in an organism's tissues. For example, a group of chemicals called PCBs are soluble in lipids and collect in the fatty tissues of animals. PCBs that are disposed in industrial wastes can remain in the environment for a long time. In the Great Lakes, studies detected PCBs in the tissues of organisms throughout the food web. As higher trophic levels fed on each other, the PCBs accumulated in each predator's fatty tissues at even higher concentrations. As you can see in Figure 36-17, the concentration of PCBs increased from 0.025 parts per million (ppm) in phytoplankton to 124 ppm in herring gull eggs. The process by which pollutants become more concentrated in successive trophic levels of a food web is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomagn.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomagn.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biological magnification</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first studied examples of biological magnification involved the pesticide DDT. Before 1971, DDT was used in the United States to control mosquitoes and agricultural pests. As with PCBs, DDT concentrates in fats and becomes magnified at each step of the food chain. When ecologists studying a decline in the populations of top-level consumers such as pelicans, ospreys, and eagles found high levels of DDT in the birds' eggs, they realized that DDT was a serious environmental problem. DDT caused the birds' egg shells to be easily breakable, thus fewer young survived to hatch. When DDT was banned in the United States, populations of these birds made a dramatic recovery.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Damage to the Ozone Shield</span><br>
Some pollution in the atmosphere affects a gas called <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gozone.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gozone.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ozone</a> (O<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span>) that has particular importance to living things. The ozone layer, a region of the atmosphere between 17 and 25 kilometers above Earth's surface, contains concentrations of ozone that absorb ultraviolet radiation, shielding organisms from its damaging effects.</p>


<p>Scientists have recorded the thinning of the ozone layer since the 1970s. A major contributor to the destruction of the layer are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) released from aerosol cans, refrigeration units, and certain manufacturing processes. These compounds destroy ozone (Figure 36-18).</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="450" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The consequences of ozone depletion for humans may include an increase in health problems such as skin cancer and cataracts, caused by more intense ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface. The radiation may also harm crops and other producers.</p>

<p>International efforts may help to minimize ozone loss and to aid in its recovery. Nearly 200 nations, including the United States, are working to eliminate the use of ozone-destroying  chemicals. For example, CFCs have been banned in many countries.</p>
