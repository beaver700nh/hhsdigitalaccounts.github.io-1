<p>Do you take part in a community recycling program or strive to save energy by turning off the lights when you leave a room? If so, you probably know that your efforts are helping to conserve natural resources and energy. The idea of conservation&#151;protecting and sustaining resources for the future&#151;can also be applied to biology. In this section you will read about what individuals and nations can do to protect habitats and conserve the diversity of life on Earth.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Why Diversity Matters</span><br>
Rain forests are one of Earth's most diverse ecosystems. The number of species in an ecosystem is one aspect of <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiodive.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiodive.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biodiversity</a>, a term that encompasses the variety of life on Earth. The other aspects of biodiversity are the variety of ecosystems in the biosphere and the genetic variety among individuals within a species. </p>

<p>Why does biodiversity matter? One basic reason is that many of the species in an ecosystem are interconnected. Species depend on community interactions for food, shelter, and other needs. If a key species disappears, other species&#151;and the health of the whole ecosystem&#151;may be affected.</p>

<p>People value biodiversity for many other reasons as well. For instance, organisms and ecosystems are a source of beauty and inspiration to many people. People also rely on a great variety of organisms as sources of oxygen, food, clothing, and shelter. Beyond providing these basics, biodiversity has aided the development of many medicines. In the United States, 25 percent of all medicines contain substances originally derived from plants.</p>

<p>For many people, the possibility of identifying new products that could help humans is a strong argument for conserving biodiversity. For example, the rosy periwinkle, which grows in the rain forests of Madagascar, yields a medicine used to treat two types of cancer: childhood leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. Deforestation in Madagascar and other rain forests threatens many rainforest species.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Threats to Biodiversity</span><br>
Throughout Earth's history, species have become extinct&#151;the last members of the population died&#151;and the species no longer exists on the planet. Periods of mass extinction occurred as a result of drastic climate change caused by volcanic eruptions or asteroid collisions. You are probably familiar with the story of one such event during the Cretaceous period, which scientists hypothesize resulted in the extinction of Earth's many dinosaur species.</p>

<p>There is currently another period of mass extinction taking place on Earth. Its exact scale is uncertain since the 1.5 million living species known to biologists are probably only a fraction of the total number of species on Earth. But there are signs that species are disappearing at a dramatic rate: </p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>About 11 percent of the 9,040 known bird species in the world are endangered.</li>
<li>Of the approximately 20,000 known plant species in the United States, at least 680 species are endangered.</li>
<li>Conservation biologists estimate that about 20 percent of the known freshwater fishes in the world have either become extinct during historical times or are threatened.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>What is causing these threats to biodiversity? The main factors are pollution, which you read about in Concept 36.4, habitat destruction, introduced species, and overexploitation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Habitat Destruction</span> As the human population grows, more land is needed for agriculture, roads, and communities. Clearing land for these uses and for obtaining natural resources such as lumber, coal, and minerals may harm or even destroy natural communities. If the organisms that require that habitat do not adapt or move to a new area, they will not survive.</p>

<p>Some changes cause a habitat to become fragmented. For example, building a road through a forest creates a barrier that may prevent species from using resources in all parts of the forest. The smaller the habitat fragments become, the fewer species each fragment can support.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Introduced Species</span> As you read in Chapter 35, introduced (non-native) species often prey on native species or compete with them for resources. If you live in a city, there's a good chance that many of the birds you see are introduced species&#151;starlings, house sparrows, and rock doves (often called pigeons). Since starlings and house sparrows were brought to the United States from Europe, these birds have competed with bluebirds for nesting spots. Losing nesting sites affected the bluebird's ability to reproduce, thereby reducing its population. As a result of recent efforts to build artificial "bluebird only" nest boxes, bluebirds are again increasing in number. (Reducing the use of pesticides on farmland has also helped bluebird populations.)</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Overexploitation</span> The right whale and the Gal&aacute;pagos tortoise are two examples of populations that have experienced <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/goverexp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/goverexp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">overexploitation</a>&#151;the practice of harvesting or hunting to such a degree that the small number of remaining individuals may not be able to sustain the population. For example, many fish populations and mollusks, such as scallops, have been overfished. Governments have placed strict limits on fishing certain species that have been threatened in this way, such as the Atlantic cod, but the ability of these species to rebound remains uncertain.</p>

<p>Another category of overexploitation includes animals that are poached, or hunted illegally, for economic reasons. Often poachers sell animal products such as elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns for large amounts of money. Other species are sold as exotic pets or decorative plants.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Conservation Biology Approaches</span><br>
What measures can be taken to protect ecosystems and species? Finding solutions and carrying them out are two goals of <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gconserv.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gconserv.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">conservation biology</a>, the application of biology to counter the loss of biodiversity.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Focusing on Hot Spots</span> Many conservation biologists have focused their attention on biodiversity "hot spots." These hot spots are small geographic areas with high concentrations of species. The total area of the hottest of these spots covers less than 1.5 percent of Earth's land surface. But this tiny area is home to one third of all species of plants and vertebrates.</p>

<p>Biodiversity hot spots also tend to be hot spots of extinction. Eleven of the hot spots shown in Figure 36-23 have lost at least 90 percent of their original habitats. They are a top priority demanding strong global conservation efforts. Conservation biologists, lawmakers, and local communities are working to preserve areas of some hot spots as nature reserves. They are exploring ways to manage these areas with the goal of meeting human needs, while still supporting the many other species living there.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Understanding an Organism's Habitat</span> Understanding the habitat requirements of a species can help biologists manage its existing habitat or create new habitat areas. Consider the example of the red-cockaded woodpecker (<i>Picoides borealis</i>), an endangered species found in very specific locations in the southeastern United States. The species prefers to nest in longleaf pines. Fungi soften the wood of these trees, making it easy for the woodpecker to drill its nest. Another critical habitat factor for this woodpecker is low-growing vegetation surrounding the pines. The birds benefit by having a clear flight path between their home trees and neighboring feeding grounds. Periodic fires that sweep through the pine forests keep the undergrowth low.</p>

<p>Although the red-cockaded woodpecker nearly became extinct due to habitat destruction caused by housing developments, it is now making a comeback. By recognizing and protecting the key habitat factors, conservation biologists are giving the woodpecker a second chance. They have set aside some protected areas of longleaf pine forests and set controlled fires to help control plant undergrowth and promote growth of the pine. As a result, the woodpeckers have survived and continue to reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Balancing Demands for Resources</span> In many cases, a tug of war exists between efforts to save species and the economic and social needs of people. Perhaps you are aware of a debate in your town or state regarding protection of an endangered species. Should a wooded habitat be conserved in an effort to save an owl population if it means putting hundreds of loggers out of work? Should work proceed on a new highway bridge if it destroys the only remaining habitat of a species of freshwater mussel? If the bridge isn't built, how will people travel to work and school? These are the types of questions raised when efforts are made to help protect biodiversity. Politicians, townspeople, and conservation biologists can reach resolution to these questions by reviewing scientific data, weighing costs and benefits, looking for alternative solutions, and casting their votes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Planning for a Sustainable Future</span> One way for nations to help protect ecosystems is to establish <a href="../../glossary/terms/z/gzonedre.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/z/gzonedre.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">zoned reserves</a>. A zoned reserve includes areas of land that are relatively undisturbed by humans, surrounded by areas that are minimally impacted by humans called <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbufferz.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbufferz.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">buffer zones</a>. The small Central American nation of Costa Rica has become a world leader in establishing zoned reserves. The Costa Rican government set aside eight zoned reserves with the goal of maintaining at least 80 percent of its natural species (Figure 36-25). Although humans live in the buffer zones, destructive environmental practices such as massive logging, large-scale single-crop agriculture, and extensive mining are discouraged. The zoned reserves encourage long-term ecosystem conservation through a balance of human needs and habitat preservation.</p>

<p>With such efforts as a model, many nations, scientific organizations, and private foundations are working toward a goal of <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsustain.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsustain.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sustainable development</a>&#151;developing natural resources so that they can renew themselves and be available for the future. People practicing sustainable development can continue to farm food and harvest timber while still protecting biodiversity. For example, a forest corridor through farmland may be left to connect two parts of an ecosystem, preventing habitat fragmentation. Timber may be harvested selectively, with only mature trees taken, instead of cutting down all the vegetation in an area. </p>

<p>Sustainable development depends on the continued research and applications of basic ecology and conservation biology. The challenge for individuals and nations is to find a way to meet the needs of Earth's human population, while conserving ecosystems and resources for the planet's other populations as well. By exploring life in your biology class this year, you and your classmates have taken an important step toward an understanding of nature that is essential to the future of the biosphere.</p>
