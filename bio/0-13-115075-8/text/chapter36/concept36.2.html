<p>All organisms require energy for growth, reproduction, and, in some species, movement. But there is a limited amount of energy available in an ecosystem&#151;an "energy budget" that is divided among the different trophic levels. This energy budget influences the types and numbers of organisms in the ecosystem.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Productivity of Ecosystems</span><br>
What determines an ecosystem's energy budget? For most ecosystems, the answer begins with the amount of sunlight that enters the ecosystem. Much of the sunlight that bombards Earth every day bounces back into space or is absorbed by the atmosphere. Of the light energy that reaches plants and other producers, only a tiny fraction&#151;about 1 percent&#151;is captured by photosynthesis. The producers convert this light energy to the chemical energy stored in organic compounds. Even such a small percentage of the sun's total energy output is enough to enable Earth's producers to manufacture billions of kilograms of organic material, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomass.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomass.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biomass</a>, each year.</p>

<p>The rate at which producers in an ecosystem build biomass is called primary productivity. The level of <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprimpro.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprimpro.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">primary productivity</a> in an ecosystem sets the energy budget. In other words, primary productivity determines the maximum amount of energy available to all the higher trophic levels in an ecosystem.</p>

<p>Figure 36-5 contrasts the net primary productivity of several different terrestrial ecosystems. (Net productivity refers to the total amount of organic material produced minus the amount used by the producers themselves to fuel their own life processes.) Notice that the productivity of the tropical rain forest is considerably higher than that of the temperate grassland, which is higher than that of the tundra. The rain forest's climate&#151;warm and humid&#151;and year-round growing season allow for high productivity. In contrast, producers in the typically cold and dry tundra grow more slowly and contribute less biomass than those in the rain forest. Conditions for producers in the grasslands fall in between, and so does their productivity.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Ecological Pyramids</span><br>
While the producers set an ecosystem's total energy budget, energy is "spent" at each step of the food web. As each consumer feeds, some energy is transferred from the lower trophic level to the higher trophic level. But most of the available energy stored in the prey organism's biomass is lost. For example, when a caterpillar eats a leaf, about 50 percent of the energy stored in the leaf passes out of the caterpillar's body in its wastes (feces). The caterpillar uses 35 percent of the leaf's stored energy to support its life processes, such as moving and reproducing. The caterpillar transforms only about 15 percent of the leaf's stored energy into new caterpillar biomass (Figure 36-6).</p>

<p>To depict information about energy, biomass, and numbers of organisms at different trophic levels, ecologists use three types of diagrams: energy pyramids, biomass pyramids, and pyramids of numbers. In each case, the foundation of the pyramid is the producer level. The primary consumers form the next block, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Energy Pyramids</span> An <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/genergyp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/genergyp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">energy pyramid</a>, sometimes called a food pyramid, emphasizes the energy loss from one trophic level to the next (Figure 36-7). In general, an average of only 10 percent of the available energy at a trophic level is converted to biomass in the next higher trophic level. The rest of the energy&#151;about 90 percent&#151;is lost from the ecosystem as heat.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>


<p>Notice in Figure 36-7 that the amount of energy available to the top-level consumer is tiny compared to that available to primary consumers. For this reason, it takes a lot of vegetation to support higher trophic levels. This explains why most food chains are limited to three or four levels; there is simply not enough energy at the top of an energy pyramid to support another trophic level. For instance, lions and killer whales have no natural predators; the energy stored in populations of these top-level consumers is not enough to feed yet another trophic level.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Biomass Pyramids</span> A <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomapy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbiomapy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">biomass pyramid</a> represents the actual biomass (dry mass of all organisms) in each trophic level in an ecosystem. Most biomass pyramids narrow sharply from the producer level at the base to the top-level consumers at the peak (Figure 36-8). There are some exceptions, however. In certain aquatic ecosystems, the zooplankton (primary consumers) consume the phytoplankton (producers) extremely rapidly. As a result, the zooplankton have a greater mass at any given time than the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton grow and reproduce at such a rapid rate that they can support a consumer population that has a greater biomass. A biomass pyramid for this ecosystem would appear top-heavy.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Pyramids of Numbers</span> A <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpyramid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpyramid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pyramid of numbers</a> depicts the number of individual organisms in each trophic level of an ecosystem. These pyramids are also organized like energy pyramids, with producers found at the foundation and higher trophic levels on each step above them. In most cases, the foundation is again the widest section, indicating that there are more individual producers than there are primary consumers, and so on (Figure 36-8). This pyramid emphasizes how few top-level consumers an ecosystem can support. Exceptions to the usual shape of a number pyramid occur when small organisms eat larger ones. For example, a single tree (producer) may be the sole food source for hundreds of insects (primary consumers).</p>
