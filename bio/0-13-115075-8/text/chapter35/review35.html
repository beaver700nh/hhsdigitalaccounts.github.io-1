<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>7.</b> Give two examples of geographic boundaries of populations.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Explain the concept of carrying capacity.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Give an example of a density-dependent factor, and describe how it might affect a population's growth.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Give an example of a density-independent factor, and describe how it might affect a population's growth.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Describe the pattern of human population growth over the last 500 years. What are some factors that have contributed to this pattern?</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>20. Analyzing Graphs</b> Examine the graph below to answer the questions.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="35images/35-cr-20.gif" width="280" height="294" alt="population of willow trees growth graph"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> During which years is this population of willow trees growing almost exponentially?<br>
<b>b.</b> What is the carrying capacity of the population?<br>
<b>c.</b> Explain why a population in nature cannot grow exponentially forever.</p>

<p><b>21. Analyzing Data</b> Use the data table below to answer the following questions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="35images/35-cr-21.gif" width="300" height="200" alt="populations of two countries graph"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> Construct an age-structure graph for each country.<br>
<b>b.</b> Based on the data, which country is more likely to have an increase in population size over the next 10 years? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>  
<b>22. Making Generalizations</b> Describe camouflage in animals. How is it an effective adaptation for both predators and prey?</p>

<p><b>23. Problem Solving</b> As a field biologist, you are studying the wildlife in a local forest. You want to know the population size of three forest species: maple trees, raccoons, and bees. Choose the sampling method you think will best estimate each population. Explain your choices.</p>

<p><b>24. Developing Hypotheses</b> A scientist staked out two plots of land with the same five wildflower species in roughly equal numbers. Around one plot, she installed a fence to keep out kangaroo rats, which feed on wildflower seeds. After two years, four of the wildflower species were gone from the fenced-in plot, but one species had increased drastically. In the unfenced plot, all five types of flowers flourished. Suggest a hypothesis to explain these results.</p>

<p><b>25. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> A population always grows until it reaches its carrying capacity.<br>
<b>b.</b> Symbiotic relationships benefit both species.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> Choose two similar species that are often found together (like pigeons and sparrows). Find three locations where both species live. Hypothesize how the features of each location affect the population of each species. Is there evidence of competitive exclusion or niche differences? Explain.</p>
