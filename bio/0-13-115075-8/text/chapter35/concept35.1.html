<p>Alligators living in a swamp make up a population&#151;members of the same species living in a specific geographic area. Other populations in the swamp include diverse species of trees, egrets and other birds, and the various species of fishes, algae, and microorganisms in the swamp water. This section explains how ecologists identify, measure, and study such populations.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Defining Populations</span><br>
Some populations change in size dramatically over time, increasing rapidly and then decreasing again. Other populations are more stable, with only small increases or decreases in the number of members over time. Several factors influence a population's size and how much it changes over time. They include the availability of food and space, weather conditions, and breeding patterns.</p>

<p>In studying how these factors affect a population, ecologists need to define the population's geographic boundaries. These boundaries might be natural, such as the edges of a lake where a particular species of catfish lives. The boundaries might be chosen to make the population easy to study, such as the walls of an aquarium in which algae are growing. A researcher exploring the effects of hunting on a deer species might define the study population as all the deer within a particular state. Another researcher studying the AIDS epidemic's effect on the human population might focus on the HIV infection rate in one nation or throughout the world.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Population Density</span><br>
Ecologists often describe a population in terms of its density. <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpopuden.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpopuden.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Population density</a> is the number of individuals of a particular species per unit area or volume. The number of alligators per square kilometer of swamp, the number of bacteria per square centimeter of an agar plate, and the number of earthworms per cubic meter of soil are all examples of population density measurements.</p>

<p>On rare occasions you can count all the individuals in a population, such as the number of beech trees in a forest measuring 50 square kilometers (km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span>). If there were 1000 beech trees in this forest, the population density would be 1000 trees per 50 km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span>. Reducing this fraction allows you to express the density of trees in a single square kilometer (20 trees per km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span>).</p>


<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">Population density </span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">&nbsp; = &nbsp;</span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall"><u>Individuals</u></span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">&nbsp; = &nbsp;</span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall"><u>1000 trees</u></span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">&nbsp; = &nbsp;</span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall"><u>20 trees</u></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">Unit area</span></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">50 km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span></span></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span></span></td>

<p>Population density is a helpful measurement for comparing populations in different locations. For example, beech trees are more dense in the above forest (20 trees/km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span>) than in a 100 km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span> forest with 500 beech trees (5 trees/km<span class="sub"><sup>2</sup></span>).</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sampling Techniques</span><br>
It usually isn't practical to count every member of a population. There may be too many individuals, or they may move around too quickly to be counted accurately, as with many species of insects, birds, and fish. In such cases, ecologists use a variety of sampling techniques to estimate the size of the population.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Quadrats</span> One method is to mark off a particular area, then count the number of a particular species within this boundary, called a quadrat. After repeating this procedure in several locations within the ecosystem, ecologists average their results to estimate the population density of this species in the ecosystem. The more quadrats they study, the more accurate the estimate.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Indirect Counting</span> A sampling technique for organisms that move around a lot or are difficult to see is indirect counting. This method involves counting nests, burrows, or tracks rather than the organisms themselves.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mark-Recapture</span> Another technique commonly used to estimate animal populations is the mark-recapture method. The biologist traps animals in the study area and marks them, such as with a drop of colored dye. The researcher then releases the marked individuals. After a period of time, the researcher again captures animals from the population and counts the marked and unmarked individuals in the second sample. The following formula then gives an estimate of the total population size:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">Total population </span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall">&nbsp; = &nbsp;</span></td>
    <td><span class="blacktextsmall"><u>number in first capture x number in second capture</u></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center"><span class="blacktextsmall">number of marked animals recaptured</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You can learn how to use this technique in Online Activity 35.1.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Limits to Accuracy</span> Most sampling techniques involve making some assumptions about the population being studied. If these assumptions are not valid, then the estimate will not be accurate. For example, the quadrat method assumes that organisms are distributed fairly evenly throughout the study area. But some populations may be arranged in clumps, such as cottonwood trees clustered near sources of water in a dry ecosystem. If the quadrat includes a clump, the estimate for the total population may be too high. If the quadrat does not include a clump, the estimate may be too low. To minimize this problem, biologists must consider how a study population is distributed when choosing an appropriate quadrat size.</p>

<p>The mark-recapture technique assumes that both marked and unmarked animals have the same chance of surviving and of being caught in the second capture. In reality, animals that have been captured once may be wary of traps and avoid being recaptured. This behavior change in previously captured animals could lead to overestimating the population size. To lessen this problem, researchers try to minimize the effects of trapping on the captured animals.</p>
