<p>In 1959, Earth's human population numbered three billion. Just 40 years later, in 1999, the population had passed the six billion mark. As the population continues to expand in the 21st century, humans will require more and more resources, including space to live, land to raise food, and places to dump wastes. As with any species, there is a limit to the population of humans that the environment can support.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">History of Global Population Growth</span><br>
For most of human history, the population has grown extremely slowly or not at all (Figure 35-10). But for the last few centuries, the human population has grown so rapidly that it resembles the exponential growth curve you read about in Concept 35.2. What circumstances accompanied this dramatic change?</p>

<p>As with other species, human population growth depends on birth rates and death rates. When birth rates go up and death rates go down, the population increases. About 10,000 years ago, in 8000 B.C.E. (before the common era), some changes in human culture started causing such an increase. Wide-scale farming began to replace hunting and gathering, providing a more plentiful food supply. More food meant people reproduced more and lived longer, and the population began to climb. Scientists estimate that by 1650 C.E. (common era), the population was 500 million. </p>

<p>In the past few centuries, death rates have continued to decline because of improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and health care. During the 150 years from 1650 to 1800, the population doubled to 1 billion. By 1930, the population doubled again to 2 billion. Doubling to 4 billion took less than 50 years. Based on falling birth rates in some countries, the United Nations predicts the growth rate will slow, but will still reach 7.9 to 10.9 billion by 2050.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Predicting Future Population Growth</span><br>
The future of human population growth is difficult to predict. Scientists use a variety of data and assumptions to develop hypotheses about future growth. Many predictions of growth in specific countries are partly based on a characteristic called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gagestru.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gagestru.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">age structure</a>. The age structure of a population is the proportion of people in different age groups. Figure 35-11 shows the age structures of the United States and Kenya. Each bar represents an age group, such as 15- to 19-year-olds. The length of the bar indicates what portion of the total population falls within that age group. (Note that the scale on the <i>x</i>-axis is different in the two graphs because their population sizes are so different.)</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 35-11<br>Age-structure graphs for the United States and Kenya show striking differences in the ages of people making up the two populations. Analyzing age structures can help scientists predict future growth in a particular country.</span></td>

<p>Kenya's population includes many more individuals who are under 30 than who are over 45. Because young people are likely to have children in the future, the population of Kenya is likely to continue to increase rapidly. In the United States, there is more of a balance in different age groups. However, there is still a bulge in the age groups that are likely to have children, and so the population is predicted to grow. In addition, high rates of immigration (people moving into the country) contribute more people to the U.S. population. Some nations currently have declining growth rates. For example, Sweden has a low birth rate and a top-heavy age structure.</p>

<p>Predictions of future trends in worldwide human population growth vary. One reason for the variation is that the projections depend on assumptions about how birth and death rates will change in various nations in the future. In many developed nations, populations are experiencing very little growth or are even declining, due to low birth rates. Most of the current population growth is occurring in less developed countries. Historically, as nations have become more developed, the birth rate has tended to decline. Will this trend continue? There is a great deal of debate and uncertainty about these assumptions and projections.</p>

<p>The different predictions also raise the question of whether Earth has a carrying capacity for humans. Even at current population levels, humans are straining the planet's natural resources. For example, water use has increased 600 percent over the past 70 years. As this level rises, there may be severe freshwater shortages in certain areas of the world.</p>

<p>In the past, new technology, especially in agriculture and medicine, enabled more people to survive and reproduce. Now researchers are asking: What level of resource use by humans can Earth support? Since usage of water and other resources varies widely among different nations, how should solutions vary in different areas? Are there new technologies that could produce food more efficiently or provide other resources?</p>
