<p>Throughout this book you have explored how biological structures are related to their functions. Neurons, the specialized cells that make up your nervous system, have structures that fit their function of communicating signals throughout your body.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Structure of a Neuron</span><br>
Though there are many different types of neurons in your body, most neurons share several common features (Figure 28-3). A typical neuron has a cell body that houses the neuron's nucleus and most of the organelles. Two types of fibers project from the cell body. Fibers called <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdendrit.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdendrit.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dendrites</a> receive signals and carry them toward the neuron's cell body. A fiber called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaxon.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaxon.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">axon</a> carries electrical impulses away from the cell body and toward other cells. The end of the axon forms a clump of knobbed branches that play a role in transmitting messages to another neuron or other cell. Some neurons have very long axons. Certain motor axons, for instance, stretch from the lower part of your spinal cord all the way to muscles in your toes.</p>

						</table></p>


<p>The axons of many neurons are insulated by a thick coat of material called a myelin sheath. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmyelins.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmyelins.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">myelin sheath</a> resembles a chain of oblong beads. Between the "beads" are uninsulated spaces called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnode.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnode.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nodes</a>. Electrical signals cannot travel along the axon where it is insulated by myelin. Instead, the signal must jump from node to node.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Neuron at Rest</span><br>
To understand nerve signals, you first need to examine a resting neuron&#151;a neuron that is not yet transmitting a signal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Resting Potential</span> Much like a battery, a resting neuron stores electrical energy. The key is the neuron's plasma membrane, which separates ions located inside and outside the cell. (Recall that ions are electrically charged atoms and molecules.) Because opposite charges attract, separating them is a form of potential energy&#151;the electrical version of water stored behind a dam. Just as the water produces pressure on the dam, holding opposite charges apart produces an electrical "pressure" called voltage. Voltage is measured in units called volts. For example, the voltage of a new flashlight battery is 1.5 volts (V), or 1500 millivolts (mV). A resting neuron is a smaller "battery," with a voltage of -70 mV (about 5 percent of a flashlight battery's voltage). The minus sign in front of the 70 indicates that the inside of the nerve cell is negative in charge compared to the outside. This voltage across the plasma membrane of a resting neuron is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gresting.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gresting.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">resting potential</a>. The word potential refers to <i>potential energy.</i></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ion Channels</span> The resting potential is based on the concentrations of various ions on opposite sides of the plasma membrane. As Figure 28-4 illustrates, sodium ions (Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) are more concentrated outside the neuron than inside. In contrast, potassium ions (K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) are more concentrated inside the cell than outside.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="400" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

								</tr>
						</table></p> 

<p>Specific proteins built into the membrane act as channels for each kind of ion. These channels allow the ions to diffuse across the membrane from where they are more concentrated to where they are less concentrated. So, Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions diffuse into the cell and K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions diffuse out. However, the membrane has many more K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ion channels than Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ion channels. Positive charge exits the cell as K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions faster than it enters as Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions. This unbalanced diffusion of positive charge is the main cause of the outside of the cell being positive compared to the inside.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ion Pumps</span> What causes the ion concentration differences? In addition to the ion channels that allow diffusion, the membrane contains a protein, called the sodium-potassium (Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>/K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>) pump, that pumps these ions back across the membrane (Figure 28-4). Pumping chemicals in a direction opposite to diffusion requires energy, like pumping water uphill against gravity. ATP is the energy source that powers the ion pumps.</p>

					

<p>The neuron's resting potential (voltage) and steep concentration differences of Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions and K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions make it sensitive to stimulation. Like a flashlight with its switch in the "off" position, the resting neuron is ready to "fire"&#151;to transmit a nerve signal.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How a Nerve Signal Travels</span><br>
All cells&#151;not just neurons&#151;have voltages across their plasma membranes. But only certain specialized cells, including neurons and muscle cells, can use this stored energy to transmit signals.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Triggering the Nerve Signal</span> If a neuron is stimulated&#151;by a tap on the knee, for example&#151;the voltage across the membrane changes at the point of stimulation. This voltage change is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdepolar.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdepolar.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">depolarization</a>, because the charge difference across the membrane decreases (the membrane depolarizes). This occurs because stimulation causes the membrane to become more permeable to Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions. Recall that Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions are much more concentrated outside the cell than inside. As Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions diffuse into the cell, the inflow of positive charge depolarizes the membrane.</p>

<p>A neuron will only "fire" if the stimulus is strong enough to depolarize the membrane to a certain level, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthresho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthresho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">threshold</a>, which is usually about -50 mV. This voltage change opens additional Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ion channels with "gates" that only open when the threshold is reached. These gated channels then allow a rush of additional Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions into the cell, causing an even greater depolarization. This stronger depolarization, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gactionp.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gactionp.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">action potential</a>, is the start of the nerve signal. In Figure 28-5 Step 1, notice that the inside of the neuron becomes positive compared to the outside as the Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions rush in. This change indicates the action potential.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 28-5<br>Once the neuron's membrane is depolarized to the threshold level, an action potential occurs. This triggers an action potential in a neighboring section of the membrane, transmitting the nerve signal along the axon.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Transmitting the Nerve Signal</span> The initial action potential occurs at the point of stimulation. But the voltage change of the action potential then opens Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ion gates nearby, causing an action potential there. This in turn triggers an action potential a little farther along the neuron, and so on. You can compare this to tipping over the first domino in a long row. The first domino does not itself travel the length of the row, but its fall is relayed all along the row, domino by domino. In the case of a neuron, "news" of the stimulus is transmitted over the length of the neuron as a series of action potentials.</p>

<p>Notice in Step 2 of Figure 28-5 that after the nerve signal passes a region of the neuron, the resting potential is restored. This is indicated in the diagram by the outside of the cell returning to positive compared to the inside. The return to resting potential is caused by the opening of K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ion gates. The K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions, more concentrated inside the cell than outside, diffuse out. </p>

<p>With each action potential, there is actually little change in the concentration differences of Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions and K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions. This is because the gated channels close again very quickly. It is like rapidly opening and closing the water gates in a dam. With each release of water, the lake level doesn't change much. However, this will eventually drain a lake that is not refilled. The neuron "refills its reservoir"&#151;restores its concentration differences of Na<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions and K<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions&#151;by using the ion pumps you read about earlier.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Speed of Transmission</span> The nerve signal can travel along a neuron's membrane at a rate of about 5 meters per second. But most of your neurons can transmit signals even faster because of the myelin sheath. The sheath surrounds the axon as a chain of cells separated by nodes. As shown in Figure 28-6, the action potential "jumps" from node to node. This transmits the nerve signal much faster than if the message had to travel the entire length of the membrane.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="330" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="28images/28-06.gif" width="330" height="466" ALT="Figure 28-6"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 28-6<br>In a neuron with a myelin sheath, a nerve signal jumps from node to node.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Neurons with myelin sheaths transmit nerve signals at a rate of about 150 meters per second&#151;30 times faster than if the signal had to take the longer route along the entire axon. A nerve signal can travel along a nerve from your spinal cord to your toes in less than 7 milliseconds!</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Measuring Stimulus Strength</span> If the stimulus is too weak to push the neuron's voltage to the threshold level, then the stimulus is "ignored"&#151;there is no action potential. If the stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold, then the neuron fires an action potential. But a very strong stimulus produces an action potential identical to one caused by a weaker stimulus that barely reaches the threshold. In other words, action potentials&#151;and thus nerve signals&#151;are all-or-none events.</p>

<p>If all action potentials are identical, how can the nervous system distinguish a strong stimulus such as a crashing cymbal from a weaker stimulus such as a chiming xylophone? As a stimulus becomes more intense, the frequency and number of action potentials increase, though the strength of each action potential remains the same. The brain hears the cymbals as loud because their crash stimulates many ear neurons, each firing many action potentials per millisecond.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Crossing Synapses</span><br>
The nervous system works by transmitting information from sensory neurons to interneurons for processing, and then to motor neurons for carrying out the response. Now that you have studied how a nerve signal travels along a neuron, the next step is to see how signals pass from one neuron to another.</p>

<p>As you read earlier, the end of a neuron's axon has many fine branches with knoblike tips. The junction between these knobs and another cell is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsynapse.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsynapse.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">synapse</a> (SIN aps). Synapses may be electrical or chemical. In an electrical synapse, the action potential at the end of the axon directly causes an electrical change in the receiving cell. Such synapses are common in your heart and digestive organs, where nerve signals maintain steady, rhythmic muscle contractions.</p>

<p>In a chemical synapse, the nerve signal must be transmitted across a tiny space called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsynapti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsynapti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">synaptic cleft</a> (Figure 28-7). For this to occur, the action potential (an electrical signal) is converted to a chemical signal. The chemical signal mostly consists of small, nitrogen-containing organic compounds called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gneurotr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gneurotr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">neurotransmitters</a>.</p>

						</table></p>
						
<p>Neurotransmitters are contained in tiny vesicles, or sacs, in the axon's knobs. When the action potential reaches the knob, it causes the vesicles to release the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and reaches the receiving neuron. Receptor molecules on the receiving neuron's membrane accept the neurotransmitter. Sometimes the result is a new impulse (action potential) in the receiving neuron. After the neurotransmitter triggers the new signal, the neurotransmitter is broken down by enzymes or reabsorbed into the sending neuron. This prevents impulses from being generated continuously in the receiving neuron. One neuron may receive hundreds or even thousands of signals simultaneously from different synapses.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Effects of Neurotransmitters</span><br>
A receiving neuron may not generate a new action potential for every incoming signal. How a neuron responds depends on its receptors and on the specific chemical effects of each neurotransmitter. Some neurotransmitters help trigger action potentials in receiving neurons. Other neurotransmitters inhibit (block) the formation of action potentials in receiving neurons. A single neuron may receive a multitude of these opposing messages at the same time. The response of the neuron depends on which type of neurotransmitter is more abundant in the synapse.</p>

<p>Researchers have identified dozens of neurotransmitters, each with specific roles in the body. For example, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released by motor neurons at synapses with skeletal muscle cells. Acetylcholine triggers a change in the muscle cell membrane that results in the muscle cell contracting.</p>

<p>Epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are other important neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Epinephrine and norepinephrine also function as hormones. In stressful situations, epinephrine and norepinephrine trigger physiological changes that result in increasing heart rate. In the brain, serotonin and dopamine trigger changes that affect sleep, mood, attention, and learning.</p>

<p>Researchers are finding that imbalances of certain neurotransmitters in the brain are associated with various kinds of mental illness. For example, low levels of norepinephrine and serotonin appear to be linked with depression. Understanding the roles of these neurotransmitters may help lead to treatments. For instance, the antidepressant drug Fluoxetine (Prozac&trade;) blocks the removal of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. This increases the amount of serotonin available to receiving neurons.</p>
