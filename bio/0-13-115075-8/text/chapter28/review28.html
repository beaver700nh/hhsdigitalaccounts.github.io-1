<p><span class="setextsubrev">Short Answer</span><br>
<b>8.</b> Describe the three types of neurons and their functions.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Summarize the knee-jerk reflex arc.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> After an action potential has passed through a section of an axon, how is the resting potential restored?</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Describe the concepts of <i>threshold</i> and "all-or-none" events in relation to action potentials. </p>

<p><b>12.</b> Choose three organs of the human body. Describe the effects of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems on each of the organs.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Describe the difference between how your brain creates a skill memory, such as using a yo-yo, and how it creates the memory of a fact, such as an address.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Identify three types of sensory receptors found in the skin. What is the function of each type of receptor?</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Explain why your night vision is mostly in black-and-white rather than color.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> What are three ways that drugs interfere with neuron or neurotransmitter activities at synapses?</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Visualizing Concepts</span><br>
<b>17.</b> A signal has been initiated in this axon, which has a myelin sheath. Draw the steps that will occur as this nerve signal travels along the axon. Provide a short explanation of each step.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrevlg">Applying Concepts</span><br>
<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>18. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Review the diagram below and answer the following questions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="28images/28-cr-18.gif" width="300" height="138" alt="motor neuron diagram"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> Identify the parts labeled <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and describe their functions.<br>
<b>b.</b> What is <i>c</i>? How would a signal travel through this neuron differently if <i>c</i> were not present?<br>
<b>c.</b> What is <i>d</i>? Explain what happens when an action potential reaches <i>d</i>.</p>

<p><b>19. Analyzing Data</b> Sound level is measured in decibels (dB). Many experts agree that exposure to sounds of more than 85 dB for 8 hours or more can damage hearing. Sounds of 110 dB can damage hearing in less than 15 minutes. Sounds of 140 dB can cause immediate damage.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="28images/28-cr-19.gif" width="265" height="210" alt="decibel level data table"></p>

<p><b>a.</b> Create a bar graph that depicts the data in the table above. In your graph, indicate the different ranges of sound danger.<br>
<b>b.</b> Explain why prolonged exposure to loud sounds can lead to hearing loss.<br>
<b>c.</b> Write a short public service announcement to explain threats to hearing loss and how to prevent hearing loss.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>  
<b>20. Comparing and Contrasting</b> Compare and contrast your nervous system to a computer.</p>

<p><b>21. Relating Cause and Effect</b> How would a drug that inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system affect a person's pulse?</p>

<p><b>22. Making Generalizations</b> Walking home from a friend's house, Raoul is confronted by a large puddle. He decides to leap across it. Which regions of his brain will be involved in this action? How will they work together? </p>

<p><b>23. Developing Hypotheses</b> Drawing on what you have learned about the different senses, develop a hypothesis that explains why some people experience motion sickness. What two senses are probably involved with this unpleasant reaction to movement?</p>

<p><b>24. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system slows digestion.<br>
<b>b.</b> Nerve signals travel quickly through a neuron's myelin sheath.<br>
<b>c.</b> The auditory tube passes on vibrations.</p>


<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> Most sensory organs come in pairs. You have two eyes and two ears. Similarly, a rattlesnake has two infrared receptors, and a butterfly has two antennae. Propose a hypothesis that could explain the advantage of having pairs of sense organs. Devise an experiment to test your hypothesis.</p>
