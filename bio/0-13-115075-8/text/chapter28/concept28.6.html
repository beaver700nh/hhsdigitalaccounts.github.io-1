<p>A drug is a substance that is used to produce an effect on the body. Drugs include chemicals used for medicinal purposes such as aspirin, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. Certain drugs affect the brain by altering the way neurons communicate.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Effects on the Nervous System</span><br>
Drugs can affect the nervous system in different ways (Figure 28-20). Some drugs increase the rate at which neurons release neurotransmitters. Other drugs slow the rate at which neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft. Rather than being broken down after prompting an action potential, the neurotransmitters remain and continue to stimulate receiving neurons. Still other drugs mimic a neurotransmitter by binding to its receptor sites, creating abnormal patterns of action potentials. You will read later in this section about how some particular groups of drugs affect the nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Tolerance and Addiction</span><br>
Any drug, even legal drugs, can be abused if instructions are not followed, the drug is taken in a manner in which it was not intended, or the drug is overused. With most drugs, abuse may lead to <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtoleran.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtoleran.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tolerance</a> of the drug. This means that more and more of the drug is needed in order to produce the same effect in the person. Use of some drugs may result in <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaddicti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaddicti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">addiction</a>, an uncontrollable dependence on a drug. A person who is addicted will experience <a href="../../glossary/terms/w/gwithdra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/w/gwithdra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">withdrawal</a> when the drug is not taken. Withdrawal symptoms can be physical or psychological and may include shaking, sweating, nausea, rapid heart rate, hallucinations, and depression.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Drug Classifications</span><br>
Different types of drugs have different effects on the body.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Stimulants</span> Drugs called <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gstimula.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gstimula.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">stimulants</a> generally increase activity in the CNS. They often do this by affecting the release or removal of neurotransmitters. For example, caffeine, which is found in colas, coffee, tea, and chocolate, raises heart rate and alertness. Nicotine, the highly addictive drug in tobacco products, is another stimulant. Nicotine can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and secretion of stomach acids.</p>

<p>Cocaine is another highly addictive stimulant. Cocaine blocks the normal removal of pleasure-inducing neurotransmitters. The excess neurotransmitters cause a temporary "high" that is soon followed by depression as the neurotransmitter levels fall to normal or below normal levels. Addiction to cocaine may cause permanent chemical changes in the brain.</p>

<p>Methamphetamine (also called speed, ice, or crank) is a stimulant that causes increased activity levels, decreased appetite, and a general sense of well-being. Chronic use can lead to violent behavior, confusion, and sleeplessness. The drug causes neurons in the brain to release large amounts of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Over time, using the drug can permanently damage the nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Depressants</span> Drugs that are classified as <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdepress.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdepress.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">depressants</a> often slow CNS activity. Alcohol is an example of a strong depressant that not only interferes with coordination and judgment, but also can cause other serious health problems. Heavy drinking can lead to severe liver and brain damage and may be associated with cardiovascular disease and several forms of cancer.</p>

<p>Other types of depressants include tranquilizers and barbiturates (sedatives). These drugs cause reduced anxiety and a state of drowsiness. Combining depressants can be fatal if the CNS is slowed until its life-sustaining functions stop.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Marijuana</span> Made from a mixture of dried pieces of the hemp plant, <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmarijua.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmarijua.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">marijuana</a> contains over 400 chemicals. The main mind-altering ingredient is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Marijuana causes many changes in the brain. Some effects include problems with memory and learning, distorted perceptions, loss of coordination, and anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Narcotics</span> Morphine, codeine, and heroin, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gopiate.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gopiate.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">opiates</a>, are narcotics derived from the opium poppy. Opiates mimic natural chemicals in the CNS and bind to their receptors. They produce feelings of euphoria, slow the brainstem's normal functioning, and block pain signals. When prescribed by a doctor, morphine and codeine can help relieve the pain of serious health problems. Heroin is too potent and addictive, however, to be used for medical purposes. Tolerance and addiction to opiates, especially heroin, can occur quickly, and withdrawal symptoms can be extremely painful.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Hallucinogens</span> Drugs called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghalluci.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghalluci.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hallucinogens</a> cause the user to see, hear, and perceive things that do not exist. Some hallucinogens are natural substances, such as certain chemicals from psilocybin mushrooms and peyote cactus. Other hallucinogens, such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), are synthetic. Using these drugs is illegal and very dangerous. The hallucinations can cause confusion and panic that can lead to severe injuries.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Ecstasy</span> A synthetic drug called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gecstasy.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gecstasy.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Ecstasy</a> causes stimulant-like effects such as increased energy level as well as hallucinogen-like  effects such as an exaggerated emotional attachment to other people. As with many other drugs, effects that users of Ecstasy perceive as positive can also be accompanied by negative effects, such as blurred vision, memory loss, and lingering paranoia. Long-term use causes changes to the brain that may interfere with its functions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Inhalants</span> The vapors of certain substances can produce mind-altering effects. These substances, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/ginhalan.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/ginhalan.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">inhalants</a>, include volatile solvents, aerosols, certain gases, and nitrites. Short-term effects of inhalant use include slurred speech, clumsiness, and increased heart rate. Long-term effects can include damage to major organs, including the lungs and liver. Many healthy, first-time users of inhalants have died suddenly from heart failure or suffocation. </p>
