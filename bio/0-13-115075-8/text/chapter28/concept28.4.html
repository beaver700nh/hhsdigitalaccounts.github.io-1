<p>The CNS consists of two structures: the spinal cord and the brain. These organs not only enable you to survive, but they also allow you to think, dream, and plan as a creative and intelligent being.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Spinal Cord</span><br>
Your spinal cord is contained within the column of vertebrae that form your backbone, or spine (Figure 28-11). The spinal cord is surrounded by fluid that cushions the cord and provides it with nutrients. The spinal cord contains interneurons and the cell bodies of motor neurons. As described in the knee-jerk example in Concept 28.1, the spinal cord processes certain types of sensory information and sends out responses via motor neurons. In addition, the spinal cord contains neurons that convey signals to and from the brain.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Brain</span><br>
Composed of about 100 billion neurons, the human brain is more complex than a computer. It receives, sorts, and delivers vast quantities of information. This section discusses the brain's major structures and functions (Figure 28-12).</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 28-12<br>The brain has many regions. The cerebral cortex (top) is the outer region of the cerebrum, the largest region of the brain. Other regions are located within or beneath the cerebrum. The cerebrum's right and left hemispheres (bottom left) are connected by a thick mass of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex has four lobes that control different functions (bottom right).</span></td>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Cerebrum</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebru.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebru.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cerebrum</a> (suh REE brum) is the largest and most complex part of the brain. It is divided into two halves called hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls movement of the right side of your body, and the right hemisphere controls movement of the left side of your body. In most people, the left hemisphere specializes in logical thinking, problem solving, and language, while the right hemisphere is more responsible for creative thoughts and imagination. The hemispheres are connected by a thick band of more than 100 million nerve fibers called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcorpusc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcorpusc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">corpus callosum</a>. The corpus callosum supports communication between the hemispheres. Beneath the corpus callosum lie the basal nuclei, small clusters of neuron cell bodies that are very important in coordinating movement.</p>

<p>The outer region of the cerebrum is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cerebral cortex</a>. Although less than 5 millimeters thick, the highly folded cerebral cortex contains 10 billion neurons and makes up about 40 percent of the brain's total mass. The cortex is divided into several lobes. Each lobe has areas with different functions. One function of the frontal lobe is to direct your voluntary muscle movements by controlling motor neurons in your spinal cord and brainstem. Other regions of the cortex create sensory perceptions&#151;what you are aware of when you see, hear, smell, taste, or sense touch.</p>

<p>In addition, the cerebral cortex is responsible for many distinctive human mental characteristics&#151;reasoning and mathematical abilities, language skills, imagination, artistic talent, and personality traits.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Cerebellum</span> Located below the cerebrum near the top of the spinal cord, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcerebel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cerebellum</a> (sehr uh BEHL um) is the coordination center for body movements. The cerebellum receives signals from the cerebrum indicating a need to move. The cerebellum also receives information from sensory receptors regarding the positions of different body parts. The cerebellum evaluates this information and, within a few milliseconds, sends a plan for coordinated movements back to the cerebrum. For instance, as you step onto an escalator, your cerebellum evaluates your body position and relays the plan for smoothly getting the rest of your body to follow. The cerebrum then fine-tunes the plan and sends appropriate commands to the muscles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Brainstem</span> The lower section of your brain, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbrainst.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbrainst.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">brainstem</a>, includes several structures: the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain. The brainstem filters all the information from the sensory and motor neurons going to and from the brain. The brainstem also regulates sleep, controls breathing, and helps coordinate body movements.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Thalamus</span> Located in the middle of the brain, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthalamu.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthalamu.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">thalamus</a> sorts information going to and coming from the cerebral cortex. The thalamus exerts some control over what information goes from sensory receptors to the cerebrum by blocking some signals and enhancing others. An example of the thalamus in action is a parent who easily sleeps through noisy street traffic, but immediately awakens upon hearing his or her baby crying.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Hypothalamus</span> The <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghypotha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghypotha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hypothalamus</a> helps to regulate body temperature, blood pressure, hunger, thirst, and emotions. It is also the master control center of the endocrine system, as you will read in Chapter 32. Part of the hypothalamus functions as a "biological clock," your body's natural timing mechanism. With input from your eyes, the clock maintains daily cycles such as sleepiness and hunger.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Memory</span><br>
As you walk to class, the location of your room and your teacher's name come quickly to mind. This is a result of your memory. Memory is the ability to store and retrieve information from past experiences.</p>

<p>Your brain forms different types of memories. For example, when you meet someone, his or her name typically is stored as a <i>short-term memory.</i> It may last for just a few minutes. In contrast, a <i>long-term memory</i> can be retrieved later. Long-term memory can be enhanced by associating new memories with old ones. For instance, it's easier to learn a new card game when you are familiar with other card games.</p>

<p>As you know, it's possible to memorize simple facts rapidly. These memories are formed by strengthening already existing nerve pathways. In contrast, learning and remembering a skill, such as tennis or skateboarding, requires nerve cells to make new connections and can be a slow process. However, once a skill memory is formed, it can be retained for a lifetime. For example, once you have learned to ride a bike, you will probably be able to ride after years without practice.</p>

<p>Long-term memories are enhanced when linked with emotions, such as joy or fear, or senses, such as sight or taste. The connection between memory, emotions, and senses is related to the <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glimbics.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glimbics.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">limbic system</a>. This region of the brain involves several different areas that integrate and relay information, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and parts of the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and thalamus (Figure 28-13). </p>
