<p>Thanks to specialized sensory receptors, humans can detect a range of stimuli. Messages transmitted from these sensory receptors enable people to see, hear, smell, taste, and sense touch.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Sensation and Perception</span><br>
Sensory receptors detect stimuli, such as light, sounds, and skin temperature, and send the information to the CNS. These receptors are found in high concentrations in your sense organs&#151;your nose, eyes, ears, mouth, and skin. When you sniff a flower, for example, the sensory receptors in your nose detect chemicals in the air near the flower. The receptors send reports about the chemicals to your brain in the form of nerve impulses. When sensory information reaches your brain, you may experience a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsensati.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsensati.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sensation</a>, an awareness of these sensory stimuli. As your brain integrates the sensory signals from your nose, you become aware of the flower's scent.</p>

<p>Besides receiving sensations, the brain also integrates new information and forms a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpercept.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpercept.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">perception</a>. Perceptions are meaningful interpretations of sensory data. Figure 28-14 illustrates the difference between a perception and a sensation. What do you see when you look at this figure? If you only see some black splotches and green space, your brain has simply developed a sensation.If you see a person riding a horse, your brain has formed a perception&#151;it has converted the sensation to a meaningful  image.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Types of Sensory Receptors</span><br>
The human body has five categories of sensory receptors that collect information from the external and internal environments. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Pain Receptors</span> All parts of your body except the brain have <i>pain receptors.</i> Pain is sensed by free nerve endings&#151;that is, the dendrites of sensory neurons&#151;rather than by separate receptor cells. Pain is important because it often indicates that your tissues are in danger. Because it is difficult to ignore, pain usually protects you by making you stop the behavior causing the pain or seek medical attention.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Thermoreceptors</span> Found in the skin and certain internal organs, <i>thermoreceptors</i> detect heat and cold. Like pain receptors, thermoreceptors are free nerve endings rather than separate cells. These receptors report information to the hypothalamus, which acts as the body's thermostat. Receiving nerve signals from different thermoreceptors, the hypothalamus regulates the body's internal temperature within a narrow range.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Mechanoreceptors</span> Your skin contains several types of <i>mechanoreceptors</i> that are stimulated by different forms of mechanical energy, including touch and pressure, stretch, and motion. In each mechanoreceptor, a change to the shape of its membrane alters its permeability to ions. This change can generate an action potential. One category of mechanoreceptors in the ears is the hair cells. The "hairs" are actually specialized cilia that detect movement. As you will read, hair cells play an important role in hearing and balance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Chemoreceptors</span> Sensory receptors such as those in your nose and taste buds that are sensitive to certain chemicals are called <i>chemoreceptors.</i> Internal chemoreceptors include sensors in arteries that detect dissolved gases in your blood. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Photoreceptors</span> Found in your eyes, <i>photoreceptors</i> are receptive to various wavelengths of light. They relay this information to the brain, resulting in vision, as you will read below.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Vision</span><br>
For most humans, more than half of the sensory input to the brain is visual. The human eye is a remarkable sense organ. Millions of sensory cells in the eyes receive light and send nerve signals to the brain. The brain analyzes the information and perceives images.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the eye's structure is the key to its function (Figure 28-15). The outer white surface of the eye is a tough layer of connective tissue called the sclera. Light enters the eyes through a transparent area of the sclera called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcornea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcornea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cornea</a>. The cornea helps to focus the light as it travels to the back of the eyeball. A thin membrane that secretes mucus keeps the cornea and the rest of the sclera moist and free of debris.</p>

The eye is a hollow ball filled with a jelly-like substance called vitreous humor. The front of the eye has a pocket filled with aqueous humor, a more watery substance. The humors play a role in the transmission and focusing of light.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Just beneath the sclera lies a pigmented layer containing blood vessels that nourish the eye. At the front of the eye, this layer forms the <a href="../../glossary/terms/i/giris.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/i/giris.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">iris</a>, which gives your eyes their color. The dark opening in the center of the iris is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpupil.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpupil.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pupil</a>. Muscles in the iris regulate the size of the pupil and control how much light reaches the interior of the eye.</p>

<p>After light passes through the pupil, it passes through the disk-shaped lens. Muscles attached to ligaments pull on the lens, changing its shape as you look at near or distant objects. The lens focuses these images on the <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gretina.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gretina.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">retina</a>, the inner surface of the eye.</p>

<p>The three most common types of visual problems are nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. These problems are related to the shape of the eyeball or a part of the eyeball (Figure 28-16). These conditions affect how well the lens can focus images on the retina.</p>

An eye with astigmatism has a misshapen lens or cornea that distorts how light strikes the retina.</span></td>

<p>The retina of each eye is lined with 130 million photoreceptor cells. These cells detect light as it moves into the eye and send signals along the optic nerve to the occipital lobe of the brain, where the signals are processed into images. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcone.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcone.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cones</a> are one type of photoreceptor. The three types of cones respond to three colors of light: blue, red, and green. Colorblindness results from a deficiency or malfunction in one or more types of cones. <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/grod.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/grod.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Rods</a>, another type of photoreceptor, do not distinguish colors, but are extremely sensitive to light. They allow people to see objects in dim light, but only in shades of gray.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Hearing and Balance</span><br>
How is listening to music related to balancing on one foot? Both hearing and balance depend on sense organs in the ear.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Hearing</span> The ear is composed of the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear (Figure 28-18). The outer ear consists of the flaplike structure known as the "ear" and a tunnel-like opening called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gauditor.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gauditor.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">auditory canal</a>. The outer ear collects sound waves, such as those produced by strumming on a guitar, and channels them to the <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/geardrum.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/geardrum.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">eardrum</a>. The eardrum is a sheet of tissue that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. When sound waves strike the eardrum, it vibrates. The eardrum passes the vibrations on to three small bones: the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. Then the vibrations pass into the inner ear through a membrane-covered hole called the oval window.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="500" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

<p>The <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gauditub.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gauditub.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">auditory tube</a> (also called the Eustachian tube) conducts air between the middle ear and the back of the throat, keeping the air pressure equal on either side of the eardrum. The tube is what enables your ear to move air in or out to equalize pressure ("popping" your ears) when you change altitude in an airplane or during a drive up a mountain. Without this correction, your eardrum would bulge inward or outward, distorting your hearing.</p>

<p>The inner ear consists of fluid-filled channels in the skull. Sound waves set this fluid in motion. One of these channels is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcochlea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcochlea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cochlea</a> (KAHK lee uh), a long, coiled tube shaped like a snail shell. Sound waves transferred by the eardrum and bones of the middle ear cause the oval window to vibrate. Then the pulsating oval window produces pressure waves in the fluid within the cochlea. These waves cause movements in hairlike projections along the membrane of the cochlea. The movements of these "hairs" initiate action potentials that are sent to the brain. The louder a sound, the stronger the vibrations of fluid in the cochlea and the more action potentials are created. Very loud sounds can damage the hair cells, causing hearing loss.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Balance</span> In addition to the cochlea, the inner ear has five fluid-filled structures that help you maintain your balance. The three semicircular canals, lined by hair cells, detect changes in the head's movement in any direction. Two other chambers lined with hair cells detect the position of your head in relation to gravity. In all of these structures, fluid movement stimulates hair cells to send action potentials to the brain. The brain then provides feedback to your muscle cells so that you can keep your balance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Smell and Taste</span><br>
Smells of dinner cooking or a favorite flower can evoke pleasant feelings. Other smells such as smoke or sour milk can cause fear or distaste. All odors originate from molecules that enter your nose. Chemoreceptors in your nose have specialized cilia coated with mucus (Figure 28-19). Chemicals dissolve in the mucus and bind to receptor molecules on the cilia, triggering action potentials. The brain integrates the signals, resulting in the perception of an odor.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>Taste also depends on chemoreceptors. When you take a bite of chocolate cake, the sweet and somewhat bitter taste of the chocolate begins with chemoreceptors in some of the 3,000 taste buds that line your tongue. Each taste bud contains specialized taste cells. Your sense of taste is stimulated when dissolved chemicals bind to receptor molecules on your taste cells. Besides the four basic human taste sensations&#151;sweet, bitter, salty, and sour&#151;researchers have recently identified receptors that sense <i>umami,</i> a meatlike taste associated with certain amino acids.</p>

<p>When you eat, the flavors you perceive are usually a combination of these various tastes, plus other sensory data such as texture and smell. The same chemicals that stimulate your taste buds also stimulate sensory receptors in your nose. This explains why food may seem bland and tasteless when your nose is stuffed up.</p>
