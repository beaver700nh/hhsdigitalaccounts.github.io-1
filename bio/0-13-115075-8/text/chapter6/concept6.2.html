<p>The plasma membrane can be thought of as the edge of life&#151;it is the boundary that separates the interior of a living cell from its surroundings. The membrane is a remarkable film so thin that you would have to stack 8,000 of them to equal the thickness of the page you are reading. Yet the plasma membrane can regulate the traffic of chemicals into and out of the cell. The key to how a membrane works is its structure.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Membrane Structure</span><br>
Membranes help keep the functions of a eukaryotic cell organized. As partitions, the membranes isolate teams of enzymes within a cell's compartments. But membranes are more than cellular room dividers. Membranes, unlike walls, regulate the transport of substances across the boundary, allowing only certain substances to pass. In this way, a membrane maintains a specific chemical environment within each compartment it encloses.</p>

<p>The plasma membrane and other membranes of a cell are composed mostly of proteins and a type of lipid called phospholipids. A phospholipid molecule (Figure 6-7) is structured much like the fat molecules you learned about in Chapter 5 but has only two fatty acids instead of three. The two fatty acids at one end (the tail) of the phospholipid are hydrophobic (not attracted to water). The other end (the head) of the molecule includes a phosphate group (PO<span class="sub"><sub>4</sub></span><span class="sub"><sup>3-</sup></span>), which is negatively charged and hydrophilic (attracted to water). Thus, the tail end of a phospholipid is pushed away by water, while the head is attracted to water.</p>

<p>The structure of phospholipids enables them to form boundaries, or membranes, between two watery environments. For example, the plasma membrane separates a cell's aqueous cytoplasm from the aqueous environment surrounding the cell (Figure 6-8). At such boundaries, the phospholipids form a two-layer "sandwich" of molecules, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gphospho.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gphospho.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">phospholipid bilayer</a>, that surrounds the organelle or cell. In the bilayer membrane, the phosphate ends face the watery inside and watery outside of the cell. The hydrophobic fatty acid tails are tucked inside the membrane, shielded from the water. These hydrophobic tails play a key role in the membrane's function as a selective barrier. Nonpolar molecules (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) cross with ease, while polar molecules (such as sugars) and many ions do not.</p>

						</table></p>
						
<p>Together, the phospholipids, proteins, and other membrane components form a dynamic structure. Membranes are fluid-like, rather than sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. Most of the proteins drift about freely in the plane of the membrane, much like "icebergs" floating in a "sea" of phospholipids.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">The Many Functions of Membrane Proteins</span><br>
Many types of proteins are embedded in the membrane's phospholipid bilayer. Other molecules, such as carbohydrates, may be attached to the membrane as well, but the proteins perform most of the membrane's specific functions. For example, sets of closely placed enzymes built into the membrane carry out some of a cell's important chemical reactions (Figure 6-9a). In Chapters 7 and 8, you will learn more about how such membrane-bound enzymes contribute to cellular processes.</p>

<p>Another  function of membrane proteins is to help cells&#151;especially cells that are part of a multicellular organism&#151;communicate and recognize each other (Figure 6-9b and c). For example, chemical signals released by one cell may be "picked up" by the proteins embedded in the membrane of another cell.</p>

<p>Still other membrane proteins, called transport proteins, help move certain substances such as water and sugars across the membrane (Figure 6-9d). Although small nonpolar molecules such as carbon dioxide and oxygen pass freely through the membrane, many essential molecules need assistance from proteins to enter or leave the cell. You will read more about how molecules move across a membrane in Concept 6.3.</p>
