<p>
Cells are as basic to biology as atoms are to chemistry. All organisms are made of cells. Organisms are either unicellular (single-celled), such as most bacteria and protists, or multicellular (many-celled), such as plants, animals, and most fungi. Because most cells cannot be seen without magnification, people's understanding of cells and their importance is relatively recent. 
</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Cell Theory</span><br>
Human understanding of nature often follows the invention and improvement of instruments that extend human senses. The development of microscopes provided increasingly clear windows to the world of cells.</p>

<p>Light microscopes, the kind used in your classroom, were first developed and used by scientists around 1600. In a light microscope, visible light passes through an object, such as a thin slice of muscle tissue, and glass lenses then enlarge the image and project it into the human eye or a camera.</p>

<p>In 1665, an English scientist named Robert Hooke observed "compartments" in a thin slice of cork (oak bark) using a light microscope. He named the compartments <i>cells.</i> Actually, Hooke was observing the walls of dead plant cells. Many more observations by many other scientists were needed to understand the importance of Hooke's discovery. By 1700, Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek (LAY vun hook) had developed simple light microscopes with high-quality lenses to observe tiny living organisms, such as those in pond water. He described what he called "animalcules" in letters to Hooke and his colleagues.</p>

<p>For the next two centuries, scientists, using microscopes, found cells in every organism they examined. By the mid-1800s, this evidence led to the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellthe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellthe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cell theory</a>&#151;the generalization that all living things are composed of cells, and that cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things. Later, the cell theory was extended to include the concept that all cells come from pre-existing cells.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Microscopes as Windows to Cells</span><br>
Light microscopes (abbreviated LM) are useful for magnifying objects up to about 1000 times their actual size. This type of microscope works for viewing objects about the size of  a bacterium or larger. But much of a cell's structure is so small that even magnifying it 1000 times is not enough to see it. Knowledge of cell structure took a giant leap forward as biologists began using electron microscopes in the 1950s. Instead of light, the electron microscope uses a beam of electrons. Certain electron microscopes can magnify objects as much as a million (1,000,000) times, enough to reveal details of the structures inside a cell.</p>

<p>Biologists use the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to study the surface structures of cells. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is used to explore their internal structure. Specimens for both types of electron microscopes must be killed and preserved before they can be examined. For this reason, light microscopes are still useful for observing living cells.</p>

<p>A photograph of the view through a microscope is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmicrogr.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmicrogr.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">micrograph</a>. Throughout your textbook, most micrographs have a notation alongside the image that indicates the kind of microscope used to view the object  and its final magnification. For example, the notation "LM 200X" indicates that the micrograph is an image made with a light microscope and shown here at a magnification of 200X, or 200 times its actual size. (You may notice that some light micrographs in your book have magnifications listed of more than 1000X. That is because the photographs have been further enlarged from the originals.)</p>

<p>As you tour the parts of a cell in this chapter, you will encounter comparisons to a scale model of a cell enlarged to the size of your classroom. At this magnification, the "classroom cell" is over 300,000 times larger than a normal cell.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">An Overview of Animal and Plant Cells</span><br>
Each part of a cell with a specific job to do is called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/o/gorganel.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/o/gorganel.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">organelle</a>, meaning "mini-organ." Cutaway diagrams of a generalized animal cell (Figure 6-4) and plant cell (Figure 6-5) show the organelles in each kind of cell. For now, the cell parts labeled in the figures are just words and structures, but these organelles will come to life as you take a closer look at how each of them works, here and later in the chapter.</p>

<p>There are more similarities between animal and plant cells than there are differences. Both kinds of cells have a thin outer covering, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmem.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gplasmem.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">plasma membrane</a>, which defines the boundary of the cell and regulates the traffic of chemicals between the cell and its surroundings. Each cell also has a prominent <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleus.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnucleus.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nucleus</a> (plural, <i>nuclei</i>), which houses the cell's genetic material in the form of DNA. In the classroom-cell scale model, the nucleus would be the size of a small car in the middle of your classroom.</p>

<p>The entire region of the cell between the nucleus and the plasma membrane is called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcytopla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcytopla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cytoplasm</a> (SYT oh plaz um), which consists of various organelles suspended in a fluid. Many of these organelles are enclosed by their own membranes. These membranes help to maintain chemical environments inside the organelles that are different from the environment of the rest of the cell.</p>

<p>If you compare Figures 6-4 and 6-5, you will see that there are a few key differences in cell structure between plants and animals. One difference is the presence of chloroplasts in some plant cells, but not in animal cells. A chloroplast is the organelle in which photosynthesis occurs. Photosynthesis converts light energy to the chemical energy stored in molecules of sugars and other organic compounds. Also, a plant cell is encased by a strong cell wall outside its plasma membrane. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellwal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellwal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cell wall</a> protects the plant cell and maintains its shape. Animal cells do not have cell walls.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Two Major Classes of Cells</span><br>
There are two basic kinds of cells. One kind&#151;a <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprokary.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprokary.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">prokaryotic cell</a> (pro KAR ee oh tik)&#151; lacks a nucleus and most other organelles. Bacteria and another group of organisms called the archaea are prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms appear earliest in Earth's fossil record. In contrast, a <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/geukaryo.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/geukaryo.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">eukaryotic  cell</a> (yoo KAR ee oh tik) has a nucleus surrounded by its own membrane, and has other internal organelles bounded by membranes. Protists, fungi, plants, and animals consist of eukaryotic cells. Organisms with eukaryotic cells appeared later in Earth's history.</p>

<p>The major difference between these two main classes of cells is indicated by their names. The word <i>eukaryotic</i> is from the Greek <i>eu</i> meaning "true," and <i>karyon</i> meaning "kernel." The kernel refers to the nucleus that eukaryotic cells have and prokaryotic cells lack. In a eukaryotic cell, the nucleus is the largest organelle. There are many other types of organelles outside the nucleus, surrounded by membranes of their own.</p>

<p>A bacterium is an example of a prokaryotic cell (<i>pro</i> means "earlier than"). Without a true nucleus and the organelles of eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells are much simpler in structure (Figure 6-6). The DNA in a prokaryotic cell is concentrated in an area called the nucleoid region, which is not separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane, as is the case in a eukaryotic cell. Most bacteria are 1 to 10 micrometers in diameter, whereas eukaryotic cells are typically 10 to 100 micrometers in diameter. You'll examine prokaryotic cells in more detail in Chapter 16. Eukaryotic cells are the main focus of this chapter.</p>
