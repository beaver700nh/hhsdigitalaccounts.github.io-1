<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>19. Analyzing Diagrams</b> Examine the diagram of the cell below and answer the following questions.<br>
<b>a.</b> Is the diagram of a eukaryotic cell or a prokaryotic cell? Explain.<br>
<b>b.</b> Which structure in the diagram carries out photosynthesis?<br>
<b>c.</b> Name three processes that involve Structure 3.<br>
<b>d.</b> Which structure manufactures proteins?<br>

<p align="center"> <img src="06images/06-cr-19.gif" width="243" height="184" alt="diagram of a cell"></p>

<p><b>20. Analyzing Diagrams</b> In the diagram below, a U-shaped glass tube contains two different sugar-water solutions. The solutions are separated by a selectively permeable membrane that sugar molecules cannot penetrate. Use the diagram to answer the questions that follow.<br>
<b>a.</b> Which solution (A or B) contains a greater concentration of solute?<br>
<b>b.</b> Predict the direction in which osmosis will occur. Explain your reasoning.<br>
<b>c.</b> Draw a diagram of how the water levels in the tube will look at equilibrium.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>21. Comparing and Contrasting</b> How are active transport and facilitated diffusion different? How are they similar?</p>
  
<p><b>22. Relating Cause and Effect</b> Explain how a protein inside the ER can be exported from the cell without ever crossing a membrane.</p>

<p><b>23. Making Generalizations</b> Give examples of how structure and function are interdependent in a cell.</p>

<p><b>24. Evaluating the Impact of Research</b> How have electron microscopes changed cell biology?</p>

<p><b>25. Evaluating Models</b> How is the classroom-size scale model of cells that was described in this chapter helpful in understanding cell structure? What drawbacks does the model have?</p>

<p><b>26. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> Cells are the same in all living things.<br>
<b>b.</b> Molecules of a solution stop moving when concentration equilibrium is reached.<br>
<b>c.</b> Ribosomes direct the activities of a cell because they produce proteins.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Design an Experiment</b> Suppose you wanted to explore the effects of osmosis on plant cells. You peel a raw potato and cut it into rectangular blocks each about 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. You place three pieces in a 15 percent salt solution, and three in distilled water. Predict how you think the potato pieces will change. What measurements would you include?</p>
