<p>While the above sentence summarizes the outcome of cellular respiration, the process actually consists of more than two dozen chemical reactions. Many of the reactions take place in specialized organelles&#151;mitochondria.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Structure of Mitochondria</span><br>
Mitochondria (singular, <i>mitochondrion</i>) are found in almost all eukaryotic cells. A mitochondrion's structure is key to its role in cellular respiration. An envelope of two membranes encloses the mitochondrion (Figure 7-16). There is a space between the outer and inner membranes. The highly folded inner membrane encloses a thick fluid called the matrix. Many enzymes and other molecules involved in cellular respiration are built into the inner membrane. The complex folding pattern of this membrane allows for many sites where these reactions can occur. This maximizes the mitochondrion's ATP production.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">A Road Map for Cellular Respiration</span><br>
Cellular respiration is one type of chemical process that takes place in cells. All together, a cell's chemical processes make up the cell's <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmetabol.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmetabol.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">metabolism</a>. Because cellular respiration consists of a series of reactions, it is referred to as a metabolic pathway. A specific enzyme catalyzes (speeds up) each reaction in a metabolic pathway.</p>

<p>Figure 7-16 is a simplified "road map" of cellular respiration. You can use the diagram to follow glucose through the metabolic pathway of cellular respiration. The three main stages are color-coded: glycolysis (green), the Krebs cycle (purple), and electron transport and ATP synthase (gold). The road map also shows where in your cells each stage occurs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Stage I: Glycolysis</span><br>
The first stage in breaking down a glucose molecule, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gglycoly.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gglycoly.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">glycolysis</a>, takes place outside the mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the cell. The word <i>glycolysis</i> means "splitting of sugar." Figure 7-17 illustrates this process. In the figure, note that glucose is shown as a chain of six carbon atoms (represented by gray balls) rather than as a ring. This allows you to focus on the number of carbon atoms in each molecule. </p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>Using two ATP molecules as an initial "investment," the cell splits a six-carbon glucose molecule in half. The result is two three-carbon molecules, each with one phosphate group. Each three-carbon molecule then transfers electrons and hydrogen ions to a carrier molecule called NAD<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span>. Accepting two electrons and one hydrogen ion converts the NAD<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> to a compound called NADH. (The yellow dots in the NADH symbols represent electrons.) The next step is the "payback" on the ATP investment&#151;four new ATP molecules are produced, a net gain of two ATP molecules.</p>	

<p>In summary, the original glucose molecule has been converted to two molecules of a substance called pyruvic acid. Two ATP molecules have been spent, and four ATP molecules have been produced. The pyruvic acid molecules still hold most of the energy of the original glucose molecule.</p>					

<p><span class="setextsub">Stage 2: The Krebs Cycle</span><br>
This stage is named for the biochemist Hans Krebs, who figured out the steps of the process in the 1930s. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/k/gkrebsc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/k/gkrebsc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Krebs cycle</a> finishes the breakdown of pyruvic acid molecules to carbon dioxide, releasing more energy in the process. The enzymes for the Krebs cycle are dissolved in the fluid matrix within a mitchondrion's inner membrane.</p>

<p>Recall that glycolysis takes place outside the mitochondrion and produces two pyruvic acid molecules. These pyruvic acid molecules do not themselves take part in the Krebs cycle. Instead, after diffusing into the mitochondrion, each three-carbon pyruvic acid molecule loses a molecule of carbon dioxide. The resulting molecule is then converted to a two-carbon compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA. This acetyl CoA molecule then enters the Krebs cycle, as shown in Figure 7-18. In the Krebs cycle, each acetyl CoA molecule joins a four-carbon acceptor molecule. The reactions in the Krebs cycle produce two more carbon dioxide molecules and one ATP molecule per acetyl CoA molecule. However, NADH and another electron carrier called FADH<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span> trap most of the energy. At the end of the Krebs cycle, the four-carbon acceptor molecule has been regenerated and the cycle can continue.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 7-18<br>Since glycolysis splits glucose into two pyruvic acid molecules, the Krebs cycle turns twice for each glucose molecule.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>As you have read, glycolysis produces two pyruvic acid molecules from one glucose molecule. Each pyruvic acid molecule is converted to one acetyl CoA molecule. Since each turn of the Krebs cycle breaks down one acetyl CoA molecule, the cycle actually turns twice for each glucose molecule, producing a total of four carbon dioxide molecules and two ATP molecules.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Stage 3: Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase Action</span><br>
The final stage of cellular respiration occurs in the inner membranes of mitochondria. This stage has two parts: an electron transport chain and ATP production by ATP synthase.</p>

<p>First, the carrier molecule NADH transfers electrons from the original glucose molecule to an electron transport chain (Figure 7-19). As you read in Concept 7.4, electrons move to carriers that attract them more strongly. In this way the electrons move from carrier to carrier within the inner membrane of the mitochondria, eventually being "pulled" to oxygen at the end of the chain. There the oxygen and electrons combine with hydrogen ions, forming water.</p>

<p>Each transfer in the chain releases a small amount of energy. This energy is used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane from where they are less concentrated to where they are more concentrated. This pumping action stores potential energy in much the same way as a dam stores potential energy by holding back water.</p>

<p>The energy stored by a dam can be harnessed to do work (such as generating electricity) when the water is allowed to rush downhill, turning giant wheels called turbines. Similarly, your mitochondria have protein structures called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gatpsynt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gatpsynt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ATP synthases</a> that act like miniature turbines. Hydrogen ions pumped by electron transport rush back "downhill" through the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase uses the energy from the flow of H<span class="sub"><sup>+</sup></span> ions to convert ADP to ATP. This process can generate up to 34 ATP molecules per original glucose molecule.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Adding Up the ATP Molecules</span><br>
When taking cellular respiration apart to see how all its metabolic machinery works, it's easy to forget the overall function. The result of cellular respiration is to generate ATP for cellular work. A cell can convert the energy of one glucose molecule to as many as 38 molecules of ATP (Figure 7-20).</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="525" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="07images/07-20.gif" width="525" height="289" ALT="Figure 7-20"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 7-20<br>The three stages of cellular respiration together produce as many as 38 ATPs for each molecule of glucose that enters the pathway.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Glycolysis produces four ATP molecules, but recall that it requires two ATP molecules as an initial energy investment. So the result is a net gain of two ATP molecules. The Krebs cycle produces two more ATP molecules (one for each three-carbon pyruvic acid molecule). And finally, the ATP synthase turbines produce about 34 more molecules of ATP.</p>

<p>Notice that most ATP production occurs after glycolysis and requires oxygen. Without oxygen, most of your cells would be unable to produce much ATP. As a result, you cannot survive for long without a fresh supply of oxygen.</p>
