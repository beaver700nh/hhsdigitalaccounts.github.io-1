<p>When you walk down the street, your lungs supply your cells with oxygen at a rate that keeps pace with ATP demand. But what happens when you sprint to catch a bus? Your leg muscles are forced to work without enough oxygen because you are spending ATP more quickly than your lungs and bloodstream can deliver oxygen to your muscles for cellular respiration. Fortunately, some of your cells can produce ATP and continue working for short periods without oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Fermentation in Human Muscle Cells</span><br>
If you exercise for a certain amount of time, your muscles must regenerate ATP. Normally, the cells can produce ATP through cellular respiration. But when you sprint, your lungs and bloodstream can't supply oxygen fast enough to meet your muscles' need for ATP. In such situations, your muscle cells use another process, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gferment.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gferment.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fermentation</a>, that makes ATP without using oxygen. Cellular respiration still continues, but it is not the main source of ATP while fermentation is occurring.</p>

<p>Fermentation makes ATP entirely from glycolysis, the same process that is the first stage of cellular respiration. Note in Figure 7-21 that glycolysis does not use oxygen.</p>

<p>As you read in Concept 7.5, glycolysis directly produces a net of two molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose it consumes. Remember that glycolysis produces 4 ATP but that 2 ATP molecules are required to power this stage, yielding a net of 2 ATP. This may not seem very efficient compared to the 38 molecules of ATP generated during all of cellular respiration. However, by burning enough glucose, fermentation can regenerate enough ATP molecules for short bursts of activity such as a sprint to catch the bus.</p>

<p>Fermentation in muscle cells produces a waste product called lactic acid. The temporary buildup of lactic acid in muscle cells contributes to the fatigue you feel during and after a long run or a set of push-ups. Your body consumes oxygen as it converts the lactic acid back to pyruvic acid. You restore your oxygen supply by breathing heavily for several minutes after you stop exercising.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Fermentation in Microorganisms</span><br>
Like your muscle cells, yeast (a microscopic fungus) is capable of both cellular respiration and fermentation. When yeast cells are kept in an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganaerob.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganaerob.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">anaerobic</a> environment&#151;an environment without oxygen&#151;they are forced to ferment sugar and other foods. In contrast to fermentation in your muscle cells, fermentation in yeast produces alcohol, instead of lactic acid, as a waste product (Figure 7-23). This fermentation reaction, called alcoholic fermentation, also releases carbon dioxide. For thousands of years, humans have put yeast to work producing alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. The carbon dioxide is what makes champagne and beer bubbly. In another example of "taming" microbes, the carbon dioxide bubbles from baker's yeast make bread rise.</p>

<p>There are also fungi and bacteria that produce lactic acid during fermentation, just as your muscle cells do. Humans use these microbes to transform milk into cheese and yogurt. The sharpness or sour flavor of yogurt and some cheeses is mainly due to lactic acid. Similar kinds of microbial fermentation turn soybeans into soy sauce and cabbage into sauerkraut.</p>	

<p>Yeast cells and muscle cells are versatile in their ability to harvest energy by either respiration or fermentation. In contrast, some bacteria found in still ponds or deep in the soil are actually poisoned if they come into contact with oxygen. These bacteria generate all of their ATP by fermentation. If you had to do that&#151;though you don't and you can't&#151;you would have to consume almost 20 times more food than normal. Oxygen enables you to get the most energy from your food. In the next chapter, you'll learn about the original source of this energy&#151;photosynthesis.</p>
