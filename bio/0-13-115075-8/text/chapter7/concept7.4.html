<p>You have read that cells, like automobile engines, use oxygen in the process of breaking down fuel. The cell's living version of internal combustion is cellular respiration. Cellular respiration converts the energy stored in food to energy stored in ATP. But how is oxygen involved?</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Relationship of Cellular Respiration to Breathing</span><br>
Cellular respiration is an <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gaerobic.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gaerobic.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">aerobic</a> process, meaning that it requires oxygen. You have probably heard the word <i>respiration</i> used to describe breathing. Although breathing for a whole organism is not the same as cellular respiration, the two processes are related (Figure 7-12).</p>

<p>During cellular respiration, a cell exchanges two gases with its surroundings. The cell takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Your bloodstream delivers oxygen to cells and carries away carbon dioxide. The process of breathing results in the exchange of these gases between your blood and the outside air. This exchange takes place in tiny air sacs in your lungs. Oxygen in the air you inhale diffuses from your lungs across the lining of the air sacs and into your bloodstream. The carbon dioxide diffuses from your blood across the air sacs' lining and into your lungs. From there it is exhaled.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Overall Equation for Cellular Respiration</span><br>
Glucose is a common fuel for cellular respiration. Figure 7-13 shows the overall equation of what happens to glucose during cellular respiration. The series of arrows indicates that cellular respiration consists of many chemical steps, not just a single chemical reaction.</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="429" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

						</table></p>
						
<p>Cellular respiration's main function is to generate ATP for cellular work. In fact, the process can produce up to 38 ATP molecules for each glucose molecule consumed. Notice that cellular respiration also transfers hydrogen and carbon atoms from glucose to oxygen atoms, thus forming water and carbon dioxide. Now, take a closer look at how these events release energy.</p>						

<p><span class="setextsub">"Falling" Electrons as an Energy Source</span><br>
Why does the process of cellular respiration release energy? For an analogy, recall the water slide. At the top, your potential energy is high. As you are pulled down the slide by the force of gravity, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Similarly, an atom's positively charged nucleus exerts an electrical "pull" on negatively charged electrons. When an electron "falls" toward the nucleus, potential energy is released.</p>

<p>Here is how "falling" electrons relate to cellular respiration. Oxygen attracts electrons very strongly, similar to how gravity pulls objects downhill. In fact, oxygen is sometimes called an "electron grabber." In contrast to oxygen, carbon and hydrogen atoms exert much less pull on electrons. A sugar molecule has several carbon-hydrogen bonds. During cellular respiration, the carbon and hydrogen atoms change partners and bond with oxygen atoms instead. The carbon-hydrogen bonds are replaced by carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen bonds. As the electrons of these bonds "fall" toward oxygen, energy is released. If you burn sugar in a test tube, this reaction happens very quickly, releasing energy in the form of heat and light (Figure 7-14). In your cells, however, the "burning" happens in controlled steps. Some of the released energy is used to generate ATP molecules instead of being converted to heat and light.</p>

								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="07images/07-14.gif" width="237" height="323" ALT="Figure 7-14"></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 7-14<br>When sugar is burned, oxygen atoms pull electrons from carbon and hydrogen, forming new chemical bonds. Burning releases energy in the form of heat and light.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Electron Transport Chains</span><br>
Compared with burning, cellular respiration is a more controlled fall of electrons&#151;more like a step-by-step "walk" of electrons down an energy staircase. Instead of releasing energy in a burst of flame, cellular respiration unlocks the energy in glucose in small amounts that cells can put to productive use&#151;the formation of ATP molecules.</p>

<p>In contrast to burning, where oxygen reacts directly with glucose, cellular respiration involves breaking down glucose in several steps. Oxygen only enters as an electron acceptor in the final electron transfer. During the breakdown, molecules called electron carriers accept many of the high-energy electrons from the glucose molecule. The electron carriers pass the electrons on to other carriers in a series of transfers called an <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gelectra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gelectra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">electron transport chain</a> (Figure 7-15). Each carrier holds the electrons more strongly than the carrier before it. At the end of the chain, oxygen&#151;the electron grabber&#151;pulls electrons from the final carrier molecule and joins them with hydrogen ions, forming water.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>
						
<p>As electrons undergo each transfer in the chain, they release a little energy. The cell has a mechanism that traps this released energy and uses it to make ATP. You will read about these events in more detail in Concept 7.5.</p>
