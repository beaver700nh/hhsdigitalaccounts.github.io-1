<p>Nutritionists recommend that adults drink nearly 2 liters of water each day. On a day when you are exercising or otherwise very active, you require even more water to replace the water lost in sweat. The water you drink is transported by your circulatory system to your cells. But for homeostasis to be maintained, the water level of blood must stay within a certain range. How does your body regulate the amount of water in blood? In this chapter, you'll learn how the kidneys regulate water balance and also how they help excrete metabolic wastes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Organs of the Excretory System</span><br>
The primary organs of the excretory system are the <a href="../../glossary/terms/k/gkidney.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/k/gkidney.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">kidneys</a>, two bean-shaped structures that excrete waste products and regulate water and salt balance. Each kidney is about the size of a clenched fist. Your kidneys are tucked up under your ribcage on either side of your spinal cord (Figure 32-4). The kidneys filter blood and produce <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gurine.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gurine.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">urine</a>, a liquid composed of water, urea, and other waste products. Extending from each kidney is a tube, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gureter.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gureter.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ureter</a> (yoo REET ur), which carries urine to the urinary bladder. The <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gurinary.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gurinary.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">urinary bladder</a> is a collapsible sac that temporarily stores urine until it is eliminated from the body. Urine leaves the bladder through another tube called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gurethra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gurethra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">urethra</a> (yoo REE thruh). The urethra extends through an opening near the vagina in females and through the penis in males.</p>

<p>While the kidneys are the primary organs involved in the removal of nitrogen-containing wastes, the skin also functions as an excretory organ. Glands in the skin secrete sweat, which contains small amounts of urea. In addition, the lungs are sometimes considered excretory organs, since they remove another metabolic waste product, carbon dioxide, from the body when you exhale.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Kidney Structure and Function</span><br>
As with the other organs you have studied in this unit, the kidney's structure fits its function. Each kidney consists of an outer region, called the renal cortex, and an inner region, called the renal medulla (Figure 32-5). (<i>Renal</i> means "related to the kidney.") Each kidney contains approximately one million microscopic filtering tubules called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnephron.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnephron.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">nephrons</a>. A nephron consists of one tubule and its associated blood vessels.</p>

						</table></p>
					
<p>When blood enters the kidneys, it is distributed through a network of branching arteries to the nephrons. Blood is processed and urine is excreted in four steps. The first step, filtration, occurs at a tiny ball of capillaries called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gglomeru.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gglomeru.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">glomerulus</a>, located at the beginning of each nephron tubule. In the glomerulus, blood pressure forces fluid through the capillary walls. This fluid, called filtrate, includes water, urea, glucose, salts, and amino acids. The filtrate is collected in a cup-shaped portion of the nephron called Bowman's capsule. From Bowman's capsule, the filtrate flows through the nephron tubule, which has two winding portions connected by a long, U-shaped region.</p>

<p>The next two steps refine the filtrate. The second step, reabsorption, takes place as the filtrate flows through the  tubule. Water and dissolved nutrients, such as glucose, salts, and amino acids, are reabsorbed from the filtrate into the blood. Active transport returns most sodium and most of the other dissolved salts and nutrients to the blood. Since the filtrate within the nephron is hypotonic compared with the surrounding blood and interstitial fluid, about 99 percent of the water in the filtrate is returned to the blood by osmosis.</p>

<p>In the third step, secretion, the kidneys remove certain substances from the blood and add them to the filtrate. For example, excess potassium ions or hydrogen ions in the blood are transported into the nephron. Secretion can also eliminate certain drugs and toxic substances from the blood. After the first three steps, filtrate contained within the nephron is called urine. In the final step, excretion, urine exits the body via the ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.</p>

<p>The kidneys perform their function continuously. They filter your entire blood supply, approximately 5 liters, as many as 400 times each day. From this enormous traffic of blood, the kidneys process about 180 liters of filtrate per day&#151;nearly the volume of three automobile gas tanks. Most of this fluid is returned to the blood. In a typical day, a person excretes only about 1.5 liters of urine.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Regulating Water Balance</span><br>
Every cell in the body is composed mostly of water. Cells also exist in a watery environment&#151;interstitial fluid. Survival depends on regulating the level of water in the body to within a certain range, which is one of the most important functions of the kidneys. Mechanisms of homeostasis regulate the amount of water reabsorbed at the kidneys. The process that regulates water balance is an example of a negative feedback loop (Figure 32-6).</p>

<p>When the water level in your body falls below the normal range, such as from drinking too little or sweating, the concentration of solutes in your blood increases (since there is less water). Certain receptor cells in your hypothalamus detect this high solute concentration in your blood. This "thirst center" in your brain produces sensations that motivate you to drink water&#151;that is, they make you thirsty. Drinking water replaces the lost fluid.</p>

<p>This region of the brain also produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is stored and released from another organ in the endocrine system, the posterior pituitary gland. (You will read more about the pituitary gland in Concept 32.4.) ADH travels in the blood to the kidneys, where it stimulates nephrons to reabsorb more water. This increased reabsorption moves water from kidney filtrate into the blood. The result is a decrease in solute concentration in the blood to the normal range. Since more water is reabsorbed, the water content of the urine decreases, causing it to be more concentrated and deeper in color.</p>

<p>When you drink too much water, your blood solute concentration can drop below the normal range. The hypothalamus and pituitary respond by releasing less ADH. The lower level of ADH decreases the amount of water reabsorbed in nephrons. As a result, the urine contains relatively more water and is lighter in color.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Treating Kidney Disease</span><br>
Some people inherit a tendency for kidney disease. Illness, injury, or poisoning can also damage the kidneys. For example, the microscopic nephron tubules can become clogged, or diseases such as arteriosclerosis can block blood flow to the kidneys. A person can survive with only one working kidney. However, if both kidneys stop functioning, toxic wastes build up in the body, resulting in life-threatening conditions.</p>

<p>One treatment for kidney failure is to process the blood outside the body, a process  called <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/gdialysi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/gdialysi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">dialysis</a> (Figure 32-7). During dialysis the patient's blood is pumped through tubes that function like nephrons. Urea and excess salts diffuse out of the blood across a membrane. Glucose and other required substances that diffuse out of the blood may also be restored. The blood is then returned to the person's body. Dialysis treatments take about four hours, and most dialysis patients require three treatments a week.</p>

<p>Another treatment for failing kidneys is to transplant a healthy kidney into the patient. But there is a risk that the recipient's body will reject the transplanted organ. Medicines that counteract organ rejection have increased the number of successful transplants. Many kidney recipients live long, healthy lives.</p>
