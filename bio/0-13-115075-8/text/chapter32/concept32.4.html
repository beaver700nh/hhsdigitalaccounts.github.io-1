<p>Have you ever had trouble staying awake while reading a book late at night? Your eyelids are heavy, and you are finding it difficult to concentrate on your reading. Your head nods and you jerk upright, shaking your head to clear your thoughts. The sleepiness you feel could be the result of a hormone called melatonin, secreted by a tiny gland of your endocrine system.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Introduction to the Endocrine System</span><br>
The feeling of drowsiness is one example of how the endocrine system helps regulate your body. The pineal gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland in the brain, manufactures and secretes the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate the body's daily and seasonal rhythms. Research indicates that light stimulates nerve signals to the brain that inhibit melatonin secretion. At night, when light is generally absent or dim, the inhibiting signals stop, allowing the pineal gland to secrete melatonin. Melatonin affects receptor areas in the brain and contributes to the feeling of drowsiness. Part of the evidence for this conclusion is that peak levels of melatonin in the body are found at night, while lowest levels are found during daylight hours.</p>

<p>Many hormones such as melatonin help regulate human body functions. The pineal gland and several other endocrine glands make up the endocrine system. A few of these glands, such as the thyroid and pituitary, have the sole function of secreting hormones. Other glands, however, have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions. The pancreas, for example, contains endocrine cells that secrete hormones that influence the level of glucose in the blood. But as you read in Chapter 29, the pancreas also has non-endocrine cells that secrete digestive enzymes into the small intestine.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Hormones Affect Target Cells</span><br>
Hormones can be classified as steroid or nonsteroid. Steroid hormones include the sex hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, as well as certain hormones secreted by the adrenal gland. Steroid hormones are lipid-soluble and can move across the plasma membrane and into a cell (Figure 32-12a). Once in the cell, each type of steroid hormone binds to a specific receptor protein, forming a steroid-receptor complex. Inside the nucleus, the steroid-receptor complex binds to DNA. This process can turn on specific genes that program the production of proteins, thus completing the response to the hormone.</p>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 32-12<br>Steroid and nonsteroid hormones affect target cells through different mechanisms.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Many of the nonsteroid hormones are modified amino acids or small polypeptides. Because they are not lipid-soluble, most nonsteroid hormones do not cross the plasma membrane. Instead, these hormones bind to specific receptor proteins located in the plasma membrane of target cells (Figure 32-12b). This action stimulates secondary messengers in the cell to activate proteins that carry out the cell's response. Figure 32-13 lists the major steroid and nonsteroid hormones secreted by the endocrine system.</p>

<p>Once a hormone reaches a target cell, it causes that cell to respond in a specific manner. Some target cells respond with a change in the permeability of their membranes. This change affects the transport of substances into and out of cells. Other cells respond by making proteins and activating (or deactivating) enzymes. Some cells respond by secreting another hormone or other product, such as a digestive enzyme.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Hypothalamus and the Pituitary</span><br>
The human endocrine system includes many organs, some of which also belong to other organ systems (Figure 32-13). The <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghypotha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghypotha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hypothalamus</a> is often referred to as the master control center of the endocrine system. First, it manufactures hormones that direct the activities of many endocrine glands, particularly the pituitary gland, as you will read in a moment. In addition, the hypothalamus receives and sends nerve signals, making the link between the nervous and endocrine systems.</p>
					
<p>As you read in Chapter 28, the hypothalamus receives information from the nerves about the status of the body's internal systems and about the condition of the external environment. With this information, the hypothalamus indirectly regulates body functions such as temperature, hunger, and thirst. The hypothalamus acts on the endocrine system by controlling the neighboring pituitary gland. The hypothalamus stimulates the <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpituita.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpituita.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pituitary gland</a> to secrete hormones that influence other glands and body functions.</p>

<p>The pituitary gland consists of two parts: the posterior (meaning "in the back") lobe and the anterior (meaning "in the front") lobe. The posterior pituitary stores and releases hormones made in the hypothalamus. For instance, the hypothalamus synthesizes antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the kidney-regulating hormone described in Concept 32.2. ADH is then channeled into the posterior pituitary for storage. When the hypothalamus detects a change indicating a low water level, it sends nerve signals that stimulate the posterior pituitary to release the stored ADH into the blood.</p>

<p>Together, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland regulate most of the endocrine system. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary through <a href="../../glossary/terms/r/greleasi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/greleasi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">releasing hormones</a> that stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete its own hormones. One example is a releasing hormone that signals the anterior pituitary to secrete growth hormone (GH). GH promotes the growth and development of the body. At the cellular level, GH stimulates protein synthesis and the use of body fat for energy metabolism. One result of overproduction of GH during childhood is a condition called giantism. Too little GH during development can lead to dwarfism. One dramatic achievement of genetic engineering is the ability to manufacture human growth hormone in other organisms for treating pituitary dwarfism in humans.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Thyroid</span><br>
Located in your neck, the <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gthyroid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gthyroid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">thyroid</a> is a butterfly-shaped gland wrapped around your trachea. Thyroid hormones affect virtually every tissue in your body. Two hormones produced by the thyroid are thyroxine and calcitonin. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Thyroxine</span> Thyroxine, the major thyroid hormone, stimulates cellular respiration. It also influences development and maturation of the body. Thyroxine helps maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, and reproductive functions. Having too much thyroxine in the blood can result in a disease called hyperthyroidism. This disorder can cause high blood pressure, weight loss, irritability, and overheating. Having too little thyroxine, a condition called hypothyroidism, can cause weight gain, tiredness, and intolerance to cold.</p>

<p>Precise regulation of the thyroid hormones is important for homeostasis. The thyroid is regulated by a releasing hormone secreted by the hypothalamus. This hormone causes the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Under the influence of TSH, the thyroid secretes its hormones.</p>

<p>You have already read that the hypothalamus receives cues about the environment via signals from the nervous system. For instance, cold temperatures cause the hypothalamus to signal increased TSH secretion from the pituitary. In response to TSH, the thyroid makes and secretes thyroxine. This increases cellular respiration, which helps warm the body.</p>

<p>A negative-feedback mechanism controls the secretion of TSH. An increase in thyroxine levels in the blood inhibits the secretion of releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. This negative-feedback loop is an important mechanism in controlling thyroxine levels in the blood.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Calcitonin</span> The thyroid also secretes calcitonin (kal sih TOH nin), a hormone involved in the regulation of calcium levels (Figure 32-15). Calcium contributes to nerve signal transmission, muscle contraction, blood clotting, the movement of materials across membranes, and bone production. Ninety-nine percent of the calcium in your body is stored in your bones. The movement of calcium between the bones and the blood ensures the smooth functioning of the body processes described above.</p>

								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>Eating calcium-rich foods increases blood calcium levels. The thyroid responds to high calcium levels by secreting calcitonin, which causes more calcium to be deposited in the bones. This action lowers the level of calcium in the blood. When the blood levels drop too low, another gland called the parathyroid releases parathyroid hormone. This reverses calcitonin's effects, releasing calcium ions from the bones.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Pancreas</span><br>
The <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gpancrea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gpancrea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">pancreas</a> produces insulin and glucagon, two hormones that manage the body's energy supply by regulating the amount of glucose in the blood. Glucose is used in cellular respiration to provide energy. Insulin and glucagon are opposing hormones and work in a negative-feedback circuit (Figure 32-16). </p>

					<p align="center"><table width="360" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="32images/32-16.gif" width="360" height="434" ALT="Figure 32-16"></td>

								<tr>
									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 32-16<br>Insulin and glucagon are two hormones that work in opposition to each other in a feedback loop that maintains homeostasis for blood glucose level.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Insulin and Glucagon</span> After a person eats a meal, the rising level of glucose in the blood stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin increases the amount of glucose that enters body cells, thereby increasing cell metabolism and decreasing the blood glucose level. The liver stores excess glucose as glycogen. When the blood glucose level falls, as it may between meals or during exercise, the pancreas responds by secreting glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates liver cells to break down glycogen into glucose. The glucose is then released into the blood, becoming available for body cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Diabetes</span> During physical exams, patients' urine samples are tested for the presence of glucose. Sugar in urine is a symptom of the disease <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdiabete.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdiabete.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">diabetes</a>, in which body cells are unable to absorb glucose from the blood. (Note that there are two diseases called diabetes: diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Here the term refers to diabetes mellitus.) More than 5 percent of the United States population suffers from this disease.</p>

<p>The symptoms of diabetes occur when there is not enough insulin in the blood or when body cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, body cells cannot obtain enough glucose. Starved for fuel, body cells will burn fat and protein supplies. Meanwhile, glucose accumulates in the blood. This excess glucose is excreted in urine and can be detected in a simple test.</p>

<p>There are two types of diabetes mellitus. Type I diabetes (also called insulin-dependent diabetes) is an autoimmune disease in which white blood cells (T cells) attack pancreas cells. As a result, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, and glucose builds up in the blood. Type I diabetes often develops before the age of 15 and requires daily doses of insulin to regulate glucose levels.</p>

<p>In type II diabetes, cells fail to respond to insulin. A tendency for this disease seems to be inherited through a gene that codes for malfunctioning insulin receptors. Ninety percent of diabetes in the United States is type II. Most cases appear after age 40 in overweight individuals. People with this form of diabetes can help manage their disease by exercising and by controlling sugar intake.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Adrenal Glands</span><br>
The two <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gadrenal.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gadrenal.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">adrenal glands</a> are located on top of the kidneys (adrenal means "on, or near, the kidneys"). These glands produce hormones in response to stress. Each adrenal gland consists of a central portion called the adrenal medulla and an outer portion called the adrenal cortex (Figure 32-17).</p>

					<p align="center"><table width="380" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="32images/32-17.gif" width="380" height="374" ALT="Figure 32-17"></td>

						</table></p>

<p>Imagine that you are walking down a quiet street at night. Suddenly a large dog jumps out at you, growling and barking. Luckily, the dog is on a leash and can't reach you. Nevertheless, even several minutes later, you can probably feel your heart pounding faster than normal within your chest. In response to the apparent threat of danger, your hypothalamus sent nerve signals directly to your adrenal glands, causing them to release a hormone called epinephrine (also called adrenaline). This hormone prepares your body for urgent action by stimulating faster breathing and heart rate. The adrenal medulla also secretes norepinephrine, which works with epinephrine to stimulate liver cells to release glucose, making more fuel available for cellular respiration. These hormones are fast-acting and have a short-term effect.</p>

<p>Hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex provide a slower, longer-acting response to stress. In stressful situations, the hypothalamus secretes a releasing hormone, which causes the anterior pituitary to secrete an adrenal-stimulating hormone called ACTH. ACTH signals cells in the adrenal cortex to make and secrete other hormones called corticosteroids. Some corticosteroids help regulate water and ion reabsorption in the kidneys. Others promote fat and protein breakdown and glucose synthesis.</p>

<p>Other hormones of the endocrine system play a major role in the reproductive system, which you will read about in the next chapter.</p>
