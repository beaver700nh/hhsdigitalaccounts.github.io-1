<p>Your liver is like a chemical processing plant within your body. It secretes bile, processes many different organic molecules, destroys old red blood cells, stores nutrients, produces blood-clotting factors, converts ammonia to urea, and changes many toxic substances to less harmful compounds. The liver also interacts with several organ systems, helping to maintain homeostasis.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Liver and Homeostasis</span><br>
As you have been reading, maintaining homeostasis requires coordinated activity between several organ systems&#151;circulatory, endocrine, digestive, nervous, excretory, and others. Your liver interacts with many of these systems. For example, the liver modifies nutrients and detoxifies substances that are absorbed by the blood in the digestive tract. The liver's key location in the pathway of blood&#151;between the intestines and the heart&#151;enables it to perform this job before the blood is distributed to the rest of the body (Figure 32-8). This maintains nutrient levels in the blood and helps ensure that toxins reach as few cells as possible.</p>

<p>Liver cells have enzymes that chemically alter many substances. For example, as you read in Concept 32.1, the liver converts ammonia into urea. The liver also carries out chemical reactions that detoxify certain poisons, such as alcohol. Additionally, the liver helps regulate the amount of glucose in the blood. One of the liver's most important functions is to convert excess glucose into glycogen (a storage polysaccharide similar to starch). The liver then stores glycogen, which can be broken down to glucose at a later time. Maintaining a constant level of glucose in the blood supports cellular metabolism and helps to maintain homeostasis in the body. The liver also manufactures most of the proteins found in blood plasma. Plasma proteins have a variety of functions. For example, the plasma protein fibrinogen can be converted to fibrin, which plays an important role in blood clotting, as described in Chapter 30.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Hepatitis and Other Liver Diseases</span><br>
The liver plays a central role in homeostasis. When the liver is not working properly, the body's internal environment becomes unstable. Damage to the liver may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, an injury, abuse of alcohol or another chemical, or other factors.</p>

<p>One liver disease is <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghepatit.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghepatit.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hepatitis</a>, a name that means "inflammation of the liver." Although hepatitis can be caused by several factors, many cases of hepatitis are traced to viral infections. Scientists have identified six types of viruses that cause hepatitis. The virus called hepatitis B is the most infectious. Approximately 10&#150;30 million people worldwide are infected each year. The hepatitis B virus is found in the saliva, semen, and blood of infected persons. The disease can be transmitted through sexual contact, kissing, the sharing of needles to inject illegal drugs, and, rarely, blood transfusions (blood banks in the United States test donated blood for hepatitis). It also can be transmitted from mother to baby during birth. Hepatitis B or alcohol abuse may lead to cirrhosis (suh ROH sis) of the liver. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcirrhos.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcirrhos.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cirrhosis</a> occurs when the liver is so scarred that it can no longer function effectively.</p>

<p>When the liver is not functioning properly, several symptoms can occur. For example, the scarring of the liver tissue blocks blood vessels. The increased blood pressure can rupture small vessels, causing internal bleeding. The liver is also responsible for manufacturing proteins that are critical for blood clotting. Liver disease can interfere with the production of these substances, making internal bleeding even more cause for concern. Also, if a diseased liver fails to make bile, the patient's ability to digest fats decreases.</p>
