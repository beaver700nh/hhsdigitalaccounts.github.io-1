<p>Have you ever noticed that when you are very thirsty, it's hard to think about anything else? This is related to the fact that maintaining the proper level of water inside your body is critical to your survival. As you read in Chapter 27, the stable internal environment in your body is called homeostasis. Maintaining water balance, regulating temperature, and removing metabolic wastes are examples of homeostasis.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Temperature Regulation</span><br>
Your body has internal processes that respond to changing external conditions. For example, when you are cold, you shiver. When you are hot, you sweat. These responses help keep your internal body temperature within a narrow range close to 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F). But what triggers these responses?</p>

<p>Your body has a temperature regulation (thermoregulation) system that works in much the same way as a home thermostat. This type of regulation is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/n/gnegativ.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/n/gnegativ.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">negative feedback</a>, because a change in conditions triggers responses in your body that counteract (negate) that change. Figure 32-2 shows how negative feedback regulates your body's internal temperature. If your body temperature rises above the set point, the thermoregulation portion of your brain senses the change. The brain then stimulates activity that counteracts the temperature increase. For example, you may sweat, which cools your body through evaporation. Also the blood vessels in your skin may dilate. This allows more blood to flow near the surface of your body, releasing heat. These responses return your internal temperature to its normal range.</p>

<p>Your body also responds if your temperature falls below the set point. Blood vessels in your skin constrict, which reduces blood flow near the surface, conserving heat. Your brain may also send signals that result in the rapid contraction of your skeletal muscles&#151;shivering&#151;which generates more heat.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Waste Disposal and Water Regulation</span><br>
In addition to temperature regulation, homeostasis depends on regulating the chemical makeup of body fluids such as blood and interstitial fluid. This is accomplished by removing waste products and balancing the intake and loss of water.</p>

<p>Your cells produce wastes as a result of their normal metabolism. For example, when a cell breaks down amino acids, a toxic substance called ammonia (NH<span class="sub"><sub>3</sub></span>) is produced. In the liver, ammonia combines with carbon dioxide, forming <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gurea.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gurea.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">urea</a>. While urea is less toxic than ammonia, it must still be eliminated from the body. The removal of nitrogen-containing wastes from the body is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gexcreti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gexcreti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">excretion</a>. The primary organs of the excretory system, including the kidneys, remove urea.</p>

<p>In addition to excreting metabolic wastes, your kidneys play a role in regulating the balance of water and salts in your body. For example, when you sweat heavily, your body loses large amounts of water. Unless the water lost by sweating is replaced, the internal environment becomes unbalanced. Too little water in body fluids results in too high a concentration of dissolved substances, which negatively affects many body functions. In response, you feel thirsty. Drinking replaces the water lost through sweating. In addition, the kidneys are stimulated to allow more water to reenter your bloodstream. In Concept 32.2 you will read more about how your body maintains water balance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Hormones and Homeostasis</span><br>
As you read in Chapter 27, chemical messengers called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghormone.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghormone.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hormones</a> trigger many of the responses that maintain homeostasis. Hormones are secreted by organs of the endocrine system called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gendocri.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gendocri.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">endocrine glands</a>. These glands secrete more than 40 different hormones. Various hormones regulate blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone, digestion, cellular metabolism, calcium and glucose levels in the blood, and salt and water balance.</p>

<p>Hormones are secreted into body fluids, usually directly into the bloodstream. A hormone may reach all parts of the body, but only certain cells, called <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtargetc.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtargetc.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">target cells</a>, are equipped to respond to that particular hormone. Molecules of a particular hormone have a specific shape, and its target cells have chemical receptors that recognize that shape. When a hormone comes in contact with cells that lack receptors for it, those cells do not respond. However, when a hormone reaches an appropriate target cell, the hormone triggers an action within that cell. Thus, a particular hormone can travel through the body and stimulate a response from target cells, while non-target cells do not respond to that particular hormone.</p>

<p>How is the action of the endocrine system different from that of the nervous system? The two systems both play roles in responding to changes in the environment. Both systems also rely on chemical messengers that influence cells. One difference between the two systems is the speed at which their messages can travel. As you read in Chapter 28, nerve signals traveling through nerve cells as action potentials trigger the release of chemical neurotransmitters. These chemical signals can directly affect other cells and result in split-second responses. In contrast, the chemical messengers of the endocrine system, hormones, travel through the blood. As a result, their effects may take minutes or even days to occur.</p>
