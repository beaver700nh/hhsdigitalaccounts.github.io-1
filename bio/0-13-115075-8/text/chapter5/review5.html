<span class="setextsubrev">Analyzing Information</span><br>
<b>14. Analyzing Diagrams</b> The reaction below shows two amino acids joining together.<br>
<b>a.</b> One product of this reaction is represented by a question mark. Which molecule is it?<br>
<b>b.</b> What is this kind of reaction called? Explain.<br>
<b>c.</b> If an amino acid were added to this chain, at what two places could it attach?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="05images/05-cr-14.gif" width="235" height="241" ALT="diagram of two amino acids joining together"></p>

<p><b>15. Analyzing Graphs</b> Use the graph to answer the questions below.<br>
<b>a.</b> At which temperature does enzyme A perform best? Enzyme B?<br>
<b>b.</b> Knowing that one of these enzymes is found in humans and the other in thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria, hypothesize which enzyme came from which organism.<br>
<b>c.</b> Propose a hypothesis that explains why the rate of the reaction catalyzed by enzyme A slows down at temperatures above 40&deg;C.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubrev">Critical Thinking</span><br>
<b>16. Making Judgments</b> Some food labels list the ingredient "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil." This means that hydrogens have been added to some of the double bonds in the oil's fatty acid chains. Does this make the food more or less healthful? Explain your answer.</p>
  
<p><b>17. Evaluating Promotional Claims</b> You hear a television commercial claiming that a snack food is low-fat because it is made with vegetable oil. What may be misleading about this claim?</p>

<p><b>18. Developing Hypotheses</b> Which of the three polysaccharides you learned about in this chapter is most likely found in paper? Explain.</p>

<p><b>19. Developing Hypotheses</b> Many humans are lactose-intolerant, meaning they cannot digest milk products containing the disaccharide lactose. Hypothesize the reason behind lactose intolerance.</p>

<p><b>20. What's Wrong With These Statements?</b><br>
<i>Briefly explain why each statement is inaccurate or misleading.</i><br>
<b>a.</b> The structure of a protein is like a long strand of yarn.<br>
<b>b.</b> Enzymes provide activation energy for reactions.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Performance Assessment</span><br>
<b>Biology Research Project</b> Research lactose intolerance and dietary solutions for lactose-intolerant individuals. Do any of the solutions relate to your hypothesis from Question 19? Write a report that summarizes your findings.</p>
