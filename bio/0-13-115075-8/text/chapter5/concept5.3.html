<p>Have you ever noticed the instruction "Shake well before using" on a bottle of salad dressing? The oil in most dressings doesn't mix well with the vinegar, which is mostly water. When you shake the bottle you force a temporary mixture long enough to douse your salad with dressing. However, the dressing will quickly separate again once you stop shaking the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Characteristics of Lipids</span><br>
Oil's inability to mix with water is typical of the class of water-avoiding compounds called <a href="../../glossary/terms/l/glipid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/l/glipid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">lipids</a>. Water-avoiding molecules are said to be <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghydrbic.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghydrbic.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">hydrophobic</a>, meaning "water-fearing." This property of lipids is important to their function. For example, lipids act as a boundary that surrounds and contains the aqueous (watery) contents of your cells. Other types of lipid molecules circulate in your body as chemical signals to cells. Still other lipids known as fats store energy in your body.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Fats</span><br>
A <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fat</a> consists of a three-carbon backbone called glycerol attached to three fatty acids, which contain long hydrocarbon chains (Figure 5-9). Some fats are solid at room temperature. Other fats called oils are liquids at room temperature. In addition to storing energy for later use, fatty tissues cushion your organs and provide your body with insulation.</p>

<p>You have probably seen the terms <i>saturated fat</i> and <i>unsaturated fat</i> on food labels. A <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsaturat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsaturat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">saturated fat</a> is a fat in which all three fatty acid chains contain the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms. In other words, all the carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains form single bonds with each other, and the rest of their bonds are with hydrogen atoms. Most animal fats, such as lard and butter, are saturated. They are solid at room temperature. An <a href="../../glossary/terms/u/gunsatur.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/u/gunsatur.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">unsaturated fat</a>, such as the one in Figure 5-9, contains less than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in one or more of its fatty acid chains because some of its carbon atoms are double-bonded to each other. The fats in fruits, vegetables, and fish are generally unsaturated, as are corn oil, olive oil, and other vegetable oils.</p>

<p>Diets rich in saturated fats may be unhealthy. Such diets may promote the buildup of lipid-containing deposits, called plaques, within the walls of blood vessels. These plaques can reduce blood flow and contribute to heart disease.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">Steroids</span><br>
A lipid molecule in which the carbon skeleton forms four fused rings is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsteroid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsteroid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">steroid</a>. While all steroids have a core set of four rings, they differ in the kinds and locations of functional groups attached to the rings.</p>

<p>Steroids are classified as lipids because they are hydrophobic, but they are very different from fats in structure and function. Some steroids circulate in your body as chemical signals. The steroids estrogen, a female sex hormone, and testosterone, a male sex hormone, function in this way (Figure 5-10). Notice the small differences in their functional groups. These variations cause some major differences in appearance between male and female mammals, including men and women.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best-known steroid is cholesterol. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcholest.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcholest.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cholesterol</a> is an essential molecule found in the membranes that surround your cells. It is also the starting point from which your body produces other steroids. Despite its necessity, cholesterol has a bad reputation because high levels of particular cholesterol-containing substances in the blood are linked to increased risk for cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease.</p>
