<p>Each of your cells is like a miniature chemical factory capable of performing thousands of different reactions. As a cell's needs change, some of these reactions speed up, while others slow down. In this section you'll read about a group of specialized proteins that coordinate the cell's chemistry.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Enzymes and Activation Energy</span><br>
To start a chemical reaction, it is first necessary to weaken chemical bonds in the reactant molecules. This activation process requires that the molecules absorb energy. For example, to burn a candle you need to provide the initial energy with a match. This "start-up" energy is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gactivat.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gactivat.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">activation energy</a> because it activates the reactants and triggers a chemical reaction.</p> 

<p>One way to provide activation energy is to heat up the mixture of molecules. Hotter molecules may collide with enough energy to weaken bonds, whereas cooler molecules collide with less energy. However, heating up a cell would cause many unnecessary reactions to occur at once, including reactions that destroy the cell's delicate structures. Instead, cellular reactions depend on the assistance of <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcatalys.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcatalys.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">catalysts</a>, compounds that speed up chemical reactions. The main catalysts of chemical reactions in organisms are specialized proteins called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/genzyme.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/genzyme.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">enzymes</a>.</p> 

<p>Enzymes provide a way for reactions to occur at the cell's normal temperature. An enzyme doesn't supply activation energy to the reacting molecules, but instead lowers the energy requirement barrier so that the reaction can proceed at normal cell temperatures. Figure 5-15 shows an analogy to help explain why reactions run faster if they require less activation energy. The rock wall represents the activation energy barrier. The frogs represent reactants and products of the reaction.</p>

<p>Each enzyme catalyzes a specific kind of chemical reaction. At any moment in the cell's life, the specific enzymes that are present and active determine which reactions occur.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">How Enzymes Work</span><br>
Just how does an enzyme catalyze only one type of reaction? The reason is that the shape of each enzyme fits the shape of only particular reactant molecules. A specific reactant acted upon by an enzyme is called the enzyme's <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsubstra.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsubstra.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">substrate</a>. The substrate fits into a particular region of the enzyme, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gactives.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gactives.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">active site</a>.</p>

<p>The fit between substrate and enzyme is not rigid. As the substrate enters, the active site changes shape slightly, fitting the substrate more snugly. This places certain functional groups of the active site in position to catalyze the reaction. The tighter grip may also bend the substrate, weakening its bonds and making them easier to break.</p> 

<p>Figure 5-16 follows the action of the enzyme sucrase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose (the substrate). (Most enzymes have names that end in -<i>ase.</i>) Sucrose is slightly distorted as it enters the active site. The weakened bond reacts with water. The result is two products: a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. Once these products are released, the enzyme's active site is ready to accept another molecule of sucrose. In fact, this recycling ability is a key characteristic of enzymes.</p>

								<tr>
									<td align="center"><img src="05images/05-16.gif" width="375" height="271" ALT="Figure 5-16"></td>

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 5-16<br>A substrate binds to an enzyme at an active site. The enzyme-substrate interaction lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. In this example, water is added to the weakened bond in sucrose, breaking sucrose into glucose and fructose.</span></td>

						</table></p>

<p>Another way that an enzyme can lower activation energy is by accepting two reactant molecules (substrates) into adjacent sites. Holding the reactants together enables them to react more easily. In this way, enzymes can catalyze the formation of larger molecules from smaller molecules.</p> 

<p>As with any other protein, an enzyme's structure and shape are essential to its function. And like other proteins, an enzyme's shape is sensitive to changes in its surrounding environment. Therefore, factors such as pH and temperature can greatly affect how well an enzyme works or if it can work at all. This is one reason why cells (and hence organisms) can only survive and function within certain ranges of conditions.</p>
