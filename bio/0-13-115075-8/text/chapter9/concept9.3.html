<p>You can think of mitosis as a lively "dance" of the chromosomes. Before the action begins, the chromatin of each chromosome doubles during interphase. Then the elaborately "choreographed" stages of the mitotic phase take place rapidly, distributing the duplicate sets of chromosomes to two daughter nuclei. Finally, cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, producing two daughter cells. In this section you will read in more detail about the processes that occur during mitosis.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Mitosis Dance </span><br>
During mitosis, the chromosomes' movements are guided by a football-shaped framework of microtubules called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gspindle.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gspindle.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">spindle</a>. The spindle microtubules grow from two <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcentros.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcentros.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">centrosomes</a>, regions of cytoplasmic material that in animal cells contain structures called centrioles. The role of centrioles in cell division remains a mystery in spite of much research into this question. Destroying them does not interfere with normal spindle formation, and most plant cells lack them entirely.</p>

<p>Figure 9-8 reveals the events taking place within an animal cell during each phase of the cell cycle. Although mitosis is a continual process, biologists divide the mitotic phase into four main stages in order to study it: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Try using different-colored toothpicks or pieces of yarn to represent chromosomes as you follow the steps of the mitosis dance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Interphase</span> As you read in Concept 9.2, during interphase the cell is busy making new molecules and organelles. The cell shown here is in late interphase (G<span class="sub"><sub>2</sub></span>). By this time the cell has duplicated its DNA. However, you can't see the individual chromosomes yet because they are still loosely packed chromatin fibers. The presence of the nucleolus indicates that the cell is still producing ribosomes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Prophase</span> In <a href="../../glossary/terms/p/gprophas.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/p/gprophas.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">prophase</a>, the first stage of mitosis, the chromosome "dancers" make their appearance on the dance floor. In the nucleus, the chromatin fibers have condensed and are thick enough to be seen with a light microscope. With high magnification, each chromosome can be clearly seen now to consist of a pair of sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The nucleolus disappears, and the cell stops making ribosomes. Late in prophase, the nuclear envelope breaks down. Meanwhile, in the cytoplasm, a football-shaped structure called the mitotic spindle forms. The chromatids now attach to the microtubules that make up the spindle. The spindle starts tugging the chromosomes toward the center of the cell for the next step in the dance.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Metaphase</span> During <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmetapha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmetapha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">metaphase</a>, the brief second stage, the chromosomes all gather in a plane across the middle of the cell. The mitotic spindle is now fully formed. All the chromosomes are attached to the spindle microtubules, with their centromeres lined up about halfway between the two ends, or poles, of the spindle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Anaphase</span> <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/ganaphas.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/ganaphas.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Anaphase</a> is the third stage of the mitosis dance. The sister chromatids suddenly separate from their partners. Each chromatid is now considered a daughter chromosome. Proteins at the centromeres help move the daughter chromosomes along the spindle microtubules toward the poles. At the same time, these microtubules shorten, bringing the chromosomes closer to the poles. However, spindle microtubules that are not attached to centromeres do just the opposite&#151;they grow longer, pushing the poles farther apart.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Telophase and Cytokinesis</span> The final stage of mitosis, <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtelopha.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtelopha.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">telophase</a>, begins when the chromosomes reach the poles of the spindle. During this stage, the processes that occurred in prophase are reversed. The spindle disappears, two nuclear envelopes reform (one around each set of daughter chromosomes), the chromosomes uncoil and lengthen, and the nucleoli reappear. Mitosis, the division of one nucleus into two genetically identical daughter nuclei, is now finished.</p>

<p>Cytokinesis completes the cell division process by dividing the cytoplasm into two daughter cells, each with a nucleus. Usually this process occurs along with telophase.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Cytokinesis in Animals and Plants</span><br>
Cytokinesis, the actual division of the cytoplasm into two cells, typically occurs during telophase. In animal cells, the first sign of cytokinesis is the appearance of an indentation around the middle of the cell, as shown in Figure 9-8. This indentation is caused by a ring of microfilaments in the cytoplasm just under the plasma membrane. The ring contracts like the pulling of a drawstring, deepening the indentation and pinching the parent cell in two. Because the two new nuclei are forming at the ends of the cell, cytokinesis results in two new cells.</p>

<p>Cytokinesis in a plant cell occurs differently (Figure 9-9). A disk containing cell wall material called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcellpla.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcellpla.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">cell plate</a> forms inside the cell and grows outward. Eventually this new piece of cell wall divides the cell in two. The result is two daughter cells, each bounded by its own continuous membrane and its own cell wall.</p>
