<p>The timing of cell division is critical to normal growth and development. A "control system" consisting of certain proteins within a cell directs the sequence of events in the cell cycle. When this control system malfunctions, cells may reproduce at the wrong time or in the wrong place. In this section, you'll discover how this abnormal cycle affects the body.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Tumors and Cancer</span><br>
Out-of-control cell reproduction can produce a mass of cells called a tumor. An abnormal mass of essentially normal cells is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/b/gbenignt.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/b/gbenignt.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">benign tumor</a>. Depending on their location in the body, benign tumors can sometimes cause health problems, but usually they can be completely removed by surgery. The cells of benign tumors always remain at their original site in the body. </p>

<p>More problematic are <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmaligna.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmaligna.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">malignant tumors</a>, masses of cells that result from the reproduction of cancer cells. <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcancer.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcancer.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Cancer</a> is a disease caused by the severe disruption of the mechanisms that normally control the cell cycle. This disruption leads to uncontrolled cell division, which if unchecked can result in death.</p>

<p>The most dangerous characteristic of cancer cells is their ability to spread. A malignant tumor displaces normal tissue as it grows, as shown in Figure 9-11. If a malignant tumor is not killed or removed, it can spread into surrounding tissues. More alarming still, cells may split off from the tumor and travel to other parts of the body, where they can form new tumors. The spread of cancer cells beyond their original site is called <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmetasta.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmetasta.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">metastasis</a> (muh TAS tuh sis).</p>

<p>Many different biochemical changes can affect the cell cycle and result in cancer. For this reason, there is no single "cure," but rather multiple approaches to controlling or halting the progress of the disease.</p>


<p><span class="setextsub">Cancer Treatment</span><br>
When possible, malignant tumors are removed by surgery. However, it's difficult to successfully remove all traces of cancer cells with surgery. To treat cancer at the cellular level, physicians sometimes use radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Both of these treatments attempt to stop cancer cells from dividing.</p>

<p>In radiation therapy, the parts of the body with cancerous tumors are exposed to high-energy radiation, which disrupts cell division. Because cancer cells divide more often than most normal cells, they are more likely to be dividing at any given time. So radiation can often destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to normal cells.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy involves treating the patient with drugs that disrupt cell division. These drugs work in a variety of ways. Some, called antimitotic drugs, prevent cell division by interfering with the mitotic spindle. One antimitotic drug prevents the spindle from forming in the first place. Another drug "freezes" the spindle after it forms, keeping it from functioning.</p>

<p>Both radiation and chemotherapy can cause undesirable side effects in normal body cells that divide fairly often. Radiation, for example, can damage cells of the ovaries or testes, causing sterility. Intestinal cells or hair follicle cells can be affected by chemotherapy, leading to nausea or hair loss.</p>
