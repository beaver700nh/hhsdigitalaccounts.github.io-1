<p>Only dogs produce more dogs, only maple trees produce more maple trees, and only people produce more people. These simple facts of life are the basis of the saying, "Like begets like." However, for sexually reproducing species, it might be more accurate to say, "Like begets similar to, but not exactly like." Most people resemble the other members of their families more closely than they resemble a stranger, but they do <i>not</i> look exactly like their parents or siblings. Each offspring in a sexually reproducing species inherits a unique combination of genes from its two parents. This combined set of genes contributes to a unique combination of traits in each individual.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Homologous Chromosomes</span><br>
Sexual reproduction depends in part on <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmeiosis.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmeiosis.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">meiosis</a> (my OH sis)&#151;a type of cell division that produces four cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In animals, meiosis occurs in the sex organs&#151;the testes in males and the ovaries in females. To understand the process of meiosis, you first need to learn a little more about chromosomes and their role in the life cycles of sexually reproducing organisms.</p>

<p>If you examined a number of cells from any individual organism, you would see that almost all the cells have the same number and types of chromosomes. Likewise, cells from different male or female individuals of a single species have the same number and types of chromosomes. For example, a typical human body cell has 46 chromosomes. A display of the 46 chromosomes of an individual is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/k/gkaryoty.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/k/gkaryoty.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">karyotype</a> (KAR ee uh type). Each chromosome has a twin that resembles it in size and shape. You inherit one chromosome of each pair from your mother and the other from your father. The two chromosomes of each matching pair are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghomolog.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghomolog.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">homologous chromosomes</a> (Figure 9-13).</p>

<p>Each homologous chromosome in a pair carries the same sequence of genes controlling the same inherited characteristics. For example, if a gene influencing eye color is located at a particular place on one chromosome, then the homologous chromosome also has a gene for eye color in the same place. However, the two genes may be slightly different versions. One chromosome might have the form of the gene for brown eye color, while the homologous chromosome might have another form for blue eye color. Note how this comparison is different from that of the sister chromatids you read about earlier in this chapter. Sister chromatids are duplicated copies of a single chromosome that are attached to each other and are identical&#151;both chromatids contain exactly the same forms of each gene.</p>

<p>Altogether, humans have 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes. For the karyotype of a human female, the 46 chromosomes fall neatly into 23 homologous pairs. But in males, the two chromosomes of one pair do <i>not</i> look alike. This 23rd pair of chromosomes, called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gsexchro.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gsexchro.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">sex chromosomes</a>, determines the person's sex. The sex chromosomes occur in two forms, called X and Y. Like all mammals, human males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Only small parts of the X and Y chromosomes are homologous. Most of the genes carried on the X chromosome do not have counterparts on the tiny Y, and the Y has genes that are lacking on the X. </p>


<p><span class="setextsub">Diploid and Haploid Cells</span><br>
Having two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent, is a key factor in the life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms. You can follow the human chromosomes through the human life cycle in Figure 9-15.</p>

<p>Almost all human cells are <a href="../../glossary/terms/d/gdiploid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/d/gdiploid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">diploid</a>; that is, they contain two homologous sets of chromosomes. The total number of chromosomes, 46 in humans, is referred to as the diploid number (abbreviated 2<i>n,</i> as in 2<i>n</i> = 46). The exceptions are egg and sperm cells, known as sex cells, or <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggamete.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggamete.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">gametes</a> (GAM eets). Each gamete has a single set of chromosomes, one from each homologous pair. A cell with a single set of chromosomes is called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghaploid.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghaploid.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">haploid</a> cell. For humans, the haploid number (abbreviated <i>n</i>) is 23. These haploid cells are produced through the process of meiosis, which you will read more about later in this section.</p>

<p>In the human life cycle, the nucleus of a haploid sperm cell from the father fuses with the nucleus of a haploid egg cell from the mother in the process of <a href="../../glossary/terms/f/gfertili.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/f/gfertili.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">fertilization</a>. The resulting fertilized egg, called a <a href="../../glossary/terms/z/gzygote.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/z/gzygote.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">zygote</a> (ZY goht), is diploid. It has two homologous sets of chromosomes, one set from each parent. During the rest of the life cycle, the zygote develops into a sexually mature adult with trillions of cells produced by mitosis. In this way, fertilization restores the diploid chromosome number, and the zygote's 46 chromosomes are passed on to all the other diploid body cells.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Process of Meiosis</span><br>
As a result of the alternation of fertilization and meiosis, life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms involve alternating diploid and haploid stages. Producing haploid gametes by meiosis keeps the chromosome number from doubling in every generation. If meiosis did not occur, cells involved in fertilization would produce new organisms having twice the number of chromosomes as those in the previous generation. Within only a few generations, there would be no more room in a cell for all the chromosomes! The alternation of meiosis and fertilization keeps the number of chromosomes in a species the same from generation to generation.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Meiosis Versus Mitosis </span> Meiosis produces haploid daughter cells from specialized cells in diploid organisms. Despite the similarity in their names, meiosis is different from mitosis in two major ways. The first major difference is that meiosis produces four new offspring cells, each with one set of chromosomes&#151;thus half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell (Figure 9-16). In contrast, mitosis produces two offspring cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The second major difference is that meiosis involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. You'll read more about this swapping process, called crossing over, in Concept 9.6. </p>

Meiosis produces four haploid cells, rather than two diploid cells. Also, meiosis involves two divisions, whereas mitosis involves only one.</span></td>

<p>As you follow the stages of meiosis in Figure 9-17, keep in mind the difference between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids. The two chromosomes of a homologous pair are individual chromosomes that were inherited from different parents. The homologous chromosomes in Figure 9-17 (and later figures) are colored red and blue to remind you that each comes from a different parent. These homologous chromosomes may contain different versions of some of their genes. For example, one chromosome may contain a form of the gene for freckles, while the homologous chromosome, at the same location, contains a form of the gene for the absence of freckles. In contrast, when sister chromatids are formed, they are identical&#151;they carry the same versions of all their genes because one was produced as an exact copy of the other. As with mitosis, meiosis begins after the chromosomes have been duplicated during interphase. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">The Two Meiotic Divisions</span> Meiosis consists of two distinct parts&#151;meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, are separated from one another. In meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated much as they are in mitosis. However, the resulting cells are haploid rather than diploid.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Prophase I:</span> In prophase I, meiosis adds two new steps to the mitosis dance routine. One new step is that proteins cause the homologous chromosomes to actually stick together along their length. The paired chromosomes, now consisting of four chromatids, are referred to as <a href="../../glossary/terms/t/gtetrad.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/t/gtetrad.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">tetrads</a>. The tetrads attach to the spindle. The second new step is that the sister chromatids in the tetrads exchange some genetic material in the process known as crossing over. The different colors in this illustration indicate that one chromosome in the tetrad was originally inherited from the male parent and the other from the female parent.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Metaphase I:</span> During metaphase I, the tetrads move to the middle of the cell and line up across the spindle.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Anaphase I:</span> In this stage, homologous chromosomes separate as they migrate to opposite poles of the spindle. Notice that the sister chromatids migrate together&#151;each chromosome is made up of two copies. Although this cell started with four chromosomes, there are only two chromosomes (each with two copies) moving to each pole.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Telophase I and Cytokinesis:</span> In telophase I, the chromosomes arrive at the poles. Each pole now has a <i>haploid</i> daughter nucleus because it has only one set of chromosomes, even though each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. Cytokinesis usually occurs along with telophase I, forming two haploid daughter cells. The chromosomes in each daughter cell are still duplicated.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Prophase II:</span> In each haploid daughter cell, a spindle forms, attaches to the centromeres, and moves the individual chromosomes to the middle of the cell.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Metaphase II:</span> The chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell with spindle microtubules attached to each sister chromatid.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Anaphase II:</span> The sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Telophase II and Cytokinesis:</span> The chromatids, now considered individual chromosomes, arrive at the poles. Cytokinesis splits the cells one more time. The process of meiosis is completed, producing four haploid daughter cells as a final result.
