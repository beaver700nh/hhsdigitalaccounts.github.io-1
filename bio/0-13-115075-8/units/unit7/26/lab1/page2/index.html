            <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
            To start your investigation, you will explore the formation of an egg in a hen's reproductive system. Female chickens hatch with two ovaries and oviducts, but only the left ovary and oviduct develop and become functional. A hen's ovary produces one yolk about once a day. Yolks are produced whether or not there are sperm present in the oviduct to fertilize them. Once a yolk is released into the oviduct, it takes about 23&#150;24 hours for the entire egg to form and be laid.</p>

            <p><b>Background</b><br>
            The egg you will study in this investigation is unfertilized. The structures that you can observe in an unfertilized egg are described below. Note that the yolk sac, allantois, chorion, and amnion membranes discussed in Concept 26.1 are not included, as these structures only develop in fertilized eggs.</p>

            <p><i><b>Yolk:</b></i> The yolk is a highly concentrated source of sugars, fat, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. For the three weeks that a chicken embryo develops inside the egg, the yolk serves as the main supply of nutrition. Attached to the yolk is the blastodisc, which in a fertilized egg would develop into the embryo. Surrounding the yolk is a membrane called the vitelline membrane. In a fertilized egg, this membrane, along with cells from the embryo, develops into the yolk sac.</p>

            <p><i><b>Egg White:</b></i> The egg white (albumen) is a gel containing water and proteins called albumin. The egg white has two layers. The outer, thinner layer contains more liquid and less protein than the thicker layer closer to the yolk. In addition to providing nutrients for the embryo, the egg white contains enzymes that attack bacteria. The egg white also functions as a shock absorber.</p>

            <p><i><b>Chalazae:</b></i> Each egg contains two chalazae (singular, <i>chalaza</i>), one on each end of the yolk. The chalazae are twisted cords of albumin that hold the yolk centered in the middle of the egg and keep the developing embryo on top even if the egg is turned in the nest.</p>

            <p><i><b>Membranes:</b></i> There are two shell membranes just under the eggshell, an inner shell membrane and an outer shell membrane made of a web of protein fibers called keratin. This protein is similar to the one that makes up your hair and fingernails. The two membranes are semipermeable barriers that allow gas exchange and help prevent water loss from the egg interior. (In a fertilized egg, the amnion and chorion play the major role in enabling gas exchange and protecting the embryo.) They also help prevent bacteria that get through the shell from reaching the embryo.</p>
		
			<p>When an egg is first laid, the shell membranes fill the interior of the shell completely. As the egg cools outside of the hen's body, the inner part of the egg contracts. The inner shell membrane separates at one end from the outer membrane, forming an air sac.</p>

            <p><i><b>Shell:</b></i> The hard shell, made of calcium carbonate, plays an important role in helping to prevent water loss. (Note that in a fertilized egg, the amnion also protects the embryo from water loss.) The shell has small pores that allow for oxygen to enter the egg and carbon dioxide to escape. The shell is deposited onto the outer shell membrane during the egg's journey through the hen's reproductive system.</p>

            <p><b>Prelab Activity</b><br>
            Follow the directions below to learn how the egg forms inside the hen. Then, answer the Prelab Questions.</p>
