&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> More snake species would be found in Florida than Alaska because snakes are ectotherms that mainly rely on environmental heat as a source of body heat.&answer2=<b>The correct answer is:</b> Ovoviviparous snakes carry their eggs internally where the eggs hatch, giving "birth" to live young. This might be an advantage because the eggs are protected from predators for a longer period of time. Also, the internal protection may help the developing embryo maintain a constant temperature.&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Like turtles, snakes are ectotherms, and have water-tight skin, three-chambered hearts, internal fertilization, bury their eggs, and rely mainly on lungs for gas exchange. Unlike turtles, snakes are legless, have no protective shell, and some are viviparous (give birth to live young).
