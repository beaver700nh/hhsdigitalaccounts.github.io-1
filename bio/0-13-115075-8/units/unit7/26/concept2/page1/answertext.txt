&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Birds are endothermic, generally maintaining a constant high internal temperature. To maintain this temperature, birds require large amounts of energy from food for their size. They also need a lot of energy from food to power their flight engines.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Birds' airfoil and lightly structured wings are forms that make flight possible. In addition, their honeycombed skeletal system makes them as light as possible (also for flight). Finally, their air sac and lung systems efficiently oxygenate the blood, maximizing flight efficiency.
