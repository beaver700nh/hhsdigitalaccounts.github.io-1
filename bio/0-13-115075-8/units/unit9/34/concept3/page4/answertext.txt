&answer1= <b>The correct answer is:</b> In the desert biome, temperatures are highest in July. Precipitation is highest in August and December.
&answer2= <b>The correct answer is:</b> The tropical rain forest has the least variation in its temperature.
&answer3= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> Both the temperate grassland and savanna are covered in grasses, but the savannas have trees. Both areas, based on the climatographs, differ significantly in both temperature and precipitation throughout the year.
&answer4= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> Temperate deciduous forests are found in areas of the world that have cold winters and warm summers. Thus, the cold initiates the loss of leaves and the warmth stimulates their development.  Since the temperature is normally warm and relatively constant throughout the year (with constant rain) in the tropical rain forest, deciduous trees would not be found. Most of the trees found are broad-leafed trees, which are not deciduous, that flourish all year long.
&answer5= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> Temperate deciduous forest (warm summers and cold winters, moderate precipitation) possesses deciduous trees, which lose their leaves in winter, bud in the spring, and maintain optimal photosynthesis in the summer.  Coniferous forest (short, cool summers and long cold winters, minimal precipitation) possesses evergreen trees (conifers), which have waxy needles to prevent water loss and have the ability to photosynthesize throughout the year.  Tundra (extremely short summer and long frozen winter, minimal precipitation) possesses no trees because of the extremely cold climate and frozen soil.
