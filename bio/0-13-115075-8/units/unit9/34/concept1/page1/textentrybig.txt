&numberqs=3&&q1=<b>1.</b> Which organisms are best adapted to survive extreme changes in the abiotic factors of the Pennsylvania forest?  &&answer1=bacteria and fungi, since they can form spores.&&q2=<b>2.</b> Which group of organisms has such diversity that some always survive changes in abiotic conditions in the Pennsylvania forest?  &&answer2=plants&&q3=<b>3.  </b> You have just predicted and seen the effects of changes in the abiotic factors in this Pennsylvania forest ecosystem. Think about these same factors: sunlight, water, and temperature, and describe what might happen to the ecosystem where you live if there were dramatic changes in these factors.  &&answer3=Your answer should consider the specific requirements needed for the survival of the common types of plants and animals found in your neighborhood. You should consider the mean temperature, hours of sunlight, and rainfall for the summer months. Then, using the same process you used to determine the effects of changes in the forest ecosystem, you should be able to determine the effect of changes in your ecosystem.&
