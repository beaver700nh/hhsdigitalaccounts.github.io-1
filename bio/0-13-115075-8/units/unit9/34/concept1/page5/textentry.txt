&numberqs=1&&q1=<b>1.</b> Which organisms had the most dramatic increase or decrease? Explain for each condition. &&answer1=<i>Increased water:</i> all the trees, except the Maple, will develop root disease and possibly die when there is a lot of water, therefore the squirrel, sparrow and grasshopper populations decline due to loss of food; bacteria will be washed away and the fungi flourish.<i>Decreased water: </i> pines and oaks tolerate drought while the dogwood and maple will die out; squirrels survive as they have plenty of food; sparrow numbers decrease significantly due to loss of grasshoppers and seeds; bacteria decrease in number and form spores; fungi die out, leaving behind airborne spores. &
