&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Darwin recognized that the evidence of ancient geologic changes he was seeing were probably similar to Earth changes he was witnessing during his time period. Layers of silt covered marine fossils, earthquakes caused changes in the geologic formations, and volcanoes covered land formations and fossils. 
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The slow changes in the geologic formations of Earth were evidence of the age of Earth. From this Darwin got a sense of the huge spans of time over which organisms could change. Darwin also noted the fact that if Earth could change so much (over a long time), then living things on Earth could perhaps change dramatically over time as well. He also noted that environmental factors change and these changes might impact animal survival.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Darwin needed to be a geologist in that he had to study and understand Earth's geologic layers and the embedded fossils that he discovered. As a biologist, Darwin compared the fossils to living organisms in the various environments that he explored.
