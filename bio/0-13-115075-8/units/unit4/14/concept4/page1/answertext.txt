&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Natural selection is most likely to lead to adaptation. Genetic drift and gene flow are processes based on random, chance events that will change the allele frequency, but not in a way that necessarily leads to adaptation.&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> When individuals move into a population or leave a population in a gene flow, the allele frequency in the population gene pool changes by a known amount. Genetic drift is a random process that results in an unpredictable change in allele frequency.
