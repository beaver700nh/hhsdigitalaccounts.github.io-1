&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The finches with the smallest beak depths (birds 2 and 3) would be least likely to survive and reproduce in a dry year. These birds would probably not be able to obtain adequate food in dry years because it would be difficult for them to use their smaller beaks to eat large seeds with hard shells and the smaller, easy-to-eat seeds are not available.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> In dry years, the medium ground finch population may have a larger average beak depth because a greater number of finches with deep beaks would be able to survive and reproduce. Finches with deeper beaks are better able to obtain food in dry years because they can eat large seeds with hard shells.
