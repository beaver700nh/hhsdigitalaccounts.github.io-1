&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Those individuals who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait have a greater chance of surviving to a reproductive age and passing their genes onto their offsping. Thus, they leave more surviving offspring than the homozygotes. This brings about a change in the allele frequency in the population. 
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> There are two basic reasons: 1) heterozygotes are healthier, and they can support larger families; 2) half the children of heterozygotes will also be heterozygote, and they are more likely to survive to adulthood since they will not be as affected by malaria.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The frequency of the sickle cell allele should decrease because the homozygotes for <i>Hb<font size="9">A</font></i> could have similar numbers of children as the heterozygotes and the frequency of the <i>Hb<font size="9">A</font></i> will increase in the gene pool.
