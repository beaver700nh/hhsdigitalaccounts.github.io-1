&answer1=<b>The correct answer is:</b> Frequency of <i>G</i> = p = 0.6; therefore, the frequency of <i>GG</i> = p2 = 0.36 x 100 = 36 and the frequency of <i>Gg</i> = 2<i>pq</i> =2x 0.6 x 0.4 x 100 = 48.
&answer2=<b>The correct answer is:</b> Hardy-Weinberg predicts that if q=0.02, then the homozygote recessive individuals (<i>cf</i> <i>cf</i>) will be q<font size="7">2</font> or (0.02)<font size="7">2</font> = 0.0004, or 1 in 2,500. 
&answer3=<b>The correct answer is:</b> If <i>q</i> = 2%25, then <i>p</i>, the frequency of the normal allele, must be 98%25. The frequency of heterozygotes should = 2<i>pq</i>  or 2 x 0.02 x 0.98 = 0.039, which is close to 4%25.
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The Hardy-Weinberg principle shows how Mendel's theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of natural selection work together. Mendel's theory explains the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts. Natural populations are not expected to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A deviation from that equilibrium usually results in evolutionary change.
