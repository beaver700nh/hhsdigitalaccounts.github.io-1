&answer1= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> The water molecules are attracted to each other by cohesion, and they form a "film" on the surface of the water. This is called surface tension, and it can support small objects like the water strider shown here.&answer2= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> The water molecules are attracted to each other and to the walls of the tubes in the stem, forming a long column of water. When a water molecule evaporates from the top of the leaves of the cattail, it pulls the column of molecules upward.&answer3= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> These positively charged ions are attracted to the slightly negatively charged oxygen-side of the water molecules. Water molecules surround the ions and keep them in solution.&answer4= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> The molecules in ice are moving very slowly. As a result, they form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds. This creates a crystalline structure that is less dense than liquid water; thus, ice floats on the surface of the pond. As a result, you can see the fish swimming in the liquid water below the ice.
