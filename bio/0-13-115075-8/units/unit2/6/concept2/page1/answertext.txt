&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> It is described as a phospholipid bilayer because there are two layers of phospholipid molecules.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The phospholipids arrange in two layers so that the charged phosphate heads interact with the water on either side of the membrane, and the lipid-like (hydrophobic) tails point away from the water and toward each other.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The phospholipid molecules have a negatively charged head region that is attracted to the positively charged region of the water molecule. As a result, the hydrophobic nonpolar tail regions are oriented away from the water, forming the interior of the membrane.
