&answer1= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> As a result of both burning and cellular respiration, carbon dioxide and water are produced, and heat is released. Oxygen is required for both of these reactions. In burning, the chemical energy stored in the sugar molecules is converted to light and heat. In cellular respiration, some of the chemical energy in the sugar is converted to energy stored in ATP and some of it is released as heat.
