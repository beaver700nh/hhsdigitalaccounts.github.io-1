&answer1= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> Characteristics of a leaf with a "super fast" rate of photosynthesis would include a large number of mesophyll cells with many chloroplasts. Inside, the chloroplasts would be packed with grana containing large amounts of chlorophyll. There would also be many stomata to bring in plenty of carbon dioxide.&answer2= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> I predict that the older, dark green leaf will have the fastest rate of photosynthesis because it has had more time to grow and develop. OR I predict that the young, light green, ivy leaf will have the fastest rate of photosynthesis.  The young leaf is actively growing and requires large amounts of energy and materials to build new cells.&answer3= <b> One example of an answer:</b> I could measure the rate at which I eat grapes. The measurement would be grapes per minute (grapes/minute).
