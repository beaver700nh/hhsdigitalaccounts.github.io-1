							<p><b>Introduction</b><br>
							To start your investigation, you will examine how a leaf rip-o-meter provides a simple way to quantitatively measure the toughness of a leaf. First you will hang a paper cup from a leaf by a paper clip. Then you will add pennies to the cup until the paper clip rips through the leaf. The number of pennies required to rip completely through the leaf is a measurement of leaf toughness. By measuring the toughness of leaves grown under different conditions, you can test many different hypotheses about the factors affecting leaf toughness.</p>

							<p><b>Background</b><br>
							A leaf's toughness depends on certain substances in its cells. Plant cells are surrounded by cell walls made of a fibrous material called cellulose. Some plant cell walls also contain a tougher fiber called lignin. Cellulose and lignin add strength and rigidity to leaves and other plant structures, helping plants stand upright and withstand the forces of wind and rain. Leaves of some plants have much tougher cell walls than others. For example, the leaves of palm trees are much tougher than the leaves of lettuce plants.</p> 

<p>To design an experiment that gives meaningful results, it is important to make sure that the experiment tests only one variable at a time. For your rip-o-meter experiment, this means that the two types of leaves you choose to test should vary in only one way. If you test leaves that vary in several ways, such as leaves from different plants that have been exposed to different amounts of sun and wind and grown in different soils, you will not be able to conclude which variable is connected to any measured differences in leaf toughness. So, for example, in the experiment that you set up for the investigation, you will test leaves from a single type of plant. In the experiment you will read about in the Prelab Activity below, notice how the student designed the experiment to control as many variables as possible.</p>

						<p><b>Prelab Activity</b><br>
						To prepare to design your own experiment using a leaf rip-o-meter, study the description of one student's experiment and complete the activity to find out the results. Then, answer the Prelab Questions.</p>

						<b>Sample Experiment</b><br>
						<b>Observation:</b> Leaves that grow on the same jasmine plant are exposed to different amounts of sun.<br><br>

						<b>Question:</b> Are jasmine leaves that are exposed to the sun for most of the daytime tougher than leaves of the same plant that are in constant shade?<br><br>

						<b>Hypothesis:</b> Jasmine leaves exposed to the sun for most of the daytime are tougher to protect them from the heat.<br><br>

						<b>Prediction:</b>  If jasmine leaves exposed to the sun are tougher, then leaves exposed to mostly shade will tear more easily.<br><br> 

						<b>Experiment:</b> I will gather one batch of sun-grown leaves and one batch of shade-grown leaves, then test both batches with the rip-o-meter.<br><br>
						
						<b>To control variables:</b>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="tabletext">I will collect leaves that are the sixth one inward from the tip of a branch,  to make sure that all the leaves will be about the same age.</span></li>
							<li><span class="tabletext">I will test five leaves of each type, calculate the average toughness of each batch then compare the results.</span></li> 
							<li><span class="tabletext">I will pierce each leaf with the rip-o-meter paper clip just below the middle vein of the leaf and add pennies to the cup until the leaf rips completely through.</span></li>
