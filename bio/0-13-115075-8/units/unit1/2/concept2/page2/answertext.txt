&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Dr. Manning wanted to find out if the plants were affected by altitude alone, so if the plants from 1000 m grew to the same height as those from 2000 m, she could conclude that something other than altitude influenced the plants' height. The control group helped to isolate altitude as the possible factor affecting growth.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The soil might have been slightly different; there may have been slightly different humidity or different amounts of wind.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Shorter plants might do well in high elevations as they are more protected from high winds, and they have less surface area from which to lose moisture in a windy and dry environment. Taller plants might do well at lower elevations where there is more competition with other plants for sunlight.
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The differences in height between the two mountainside populations was probably due to the differences in the environments in which the plants grew.
