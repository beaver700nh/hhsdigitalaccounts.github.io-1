&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The pine cones and rocks used as landmarks have a number of characteristics that might be important to the wasps.  In addition to responding to the landmark patterns, the wasps may be responding to odor, texture, or how the landmark stands out from its surroundings.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> One possible solution would be to train the wasp to fly to two different types of landmarks surrounding the nest--first a circle of pine cones and then a circle of odor-carrying pieces of cloth. Next, the test would provide the returning wasp with a choice of the two circles that have been moved away from the nest--the circle of pine cones and the circle of odor objects.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> One possible design would be to train the wasp to fly to two different types of circles, each surrounding the same nest in turn--a circle of pine cones and a circle of round, brown cardboard disks that lay flat on the ground. Next, the test would provide the returning wasp with a choice of the two circles placed to either side of the nest--the circle of pine cones and the circle of odor objects.
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> When Tinbergen first found the wasps, he asked the question:  "Do the wasps always return to one burrow?"  This is "discovery science."  Tinbergen's question  "How do the wasps find their nests?" led to "hypothesis-based science."
