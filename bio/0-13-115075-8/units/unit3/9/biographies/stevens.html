<br><br>
					In the 1800s, women were not expected to become highly educated or pursue careers. They certainly were not expected to study microorganisms or beetle larvae! Nettie Stevens, however, broke the mold. Born in Vermont in 1861, Stevens would go on to become a librarian. At age 35, she decided that she wanted to get more education and, using the money she had saved from her job as a librarian, she enrolled at Stanford University to study physiology. Later, she earned a Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College. <br><br>

Stevens became intrigued with microscopic marine life and made meticulous notes and drawings of new species of marine organisms. This attention to detail would serve her well in her later research. She traveled to Europe and worked with Theodor Boveri at the Zoological Institute at W&uuml;rzburg, Germany, studying chromosomes and their role in heredity. She then went to Carnegie Institute, where she made history. <br><br> 

At the beginning of the 1900s, scientists were still arguing whether gender was inherited or was caused by the embryo's environment. Stevens decided to find out. She studied the chromosomes of the mealworm larva (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>). By examining the chromosomes of the body cells of male and female larvae, she found that males had 19 1/2 chromosomes while females had 20. She called the male half&#150;chromosome Y and named its female counterpart X. She then studied the sex cells (gametes), which have half the number of chromosomes. She discovered that the egg contained 10 full&#150;sized chromosomes, including the X chromosome, while the sperm could contain either 10 full&#150;sized chromosomes or 9 1/2&#151;that is, either an X or a Y. Upon further study, Stevens found that when fertilization occurred with a sperm containing an X chromosome, the offspring was a girl. When fertilization occurred with a sperm containing a Y chromosome, the offspring was a boy. Stevens determined that the half&#150;chromosome, the Y, determined maleness; with all Xs, the organism was a female.  She published her results in 1905, but they were not accepted until Edmund Wilson, a male New York biologist, made the same discovery later in the year.<br><br>

Stevens continued her work studying the role of sex chromosomes and eventually determined that many other organisms also have X and Y chromosomes responsible for gender. She also discovered that chromosomes exist in pairs. In 1944, she was elected to the U.S. National Women's Hall of Fame.
