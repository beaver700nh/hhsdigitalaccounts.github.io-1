<br><br>
					When Nancy Wexler was a teenager, she witnessed and wondered about the erratic behavior of three of her uncles. Their muscles moved uncontrollably, and they had frequent mental lapses. All three of them were eventually diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, an inherited disease that usually appears when people are in their forties or fifties. <br><br>

Wexler learned that her mother also had a 50 percent chance of having the disease. Wexler watched helplessly as her mother developed the symptoms of Huntington's Disease, robbing her of mental capacity and muscle control. When her mother finally died, Wexler decided that she would spend her life working to find the cause and cure of this disease, which affects 1 in every 20,000 people. She went to college and graduate school, studying neuropsychology. In 1969, she became president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which studies the causes of inherited diseases. <br><br> 

In 1979, Wexler learned about a village in Venezuela that had an unusually high proportion of people with Huntington's Disease. These people were all part of a very large family, which could be traced back to one woman who lived in the early 1800s. Wexler and her colleagues went to this village, San Luis, many times during the 1980s to collect blood and create a pedigree. There are now more than 15,000 people entered into this pedigree, making it the <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/GeneticTrail/searching/search.htm">largest known pedigree in the world</a>. (Scroll down the page to view a photo of Nancy and the pedigree.)<br><br>

As a result of years of analysis, scientists were able to determine the genetic mistake that repeats itself on the tip of chromosome 4. Armed with this knowledge, geneticists can now determine if someone will get the disease in the future by examining the chromosomes in that person's body cells. <br><br>

Although this technology is in place, Wexler and her sister have elected not to be tested to see if they have the gene. Wexler is now the age that her mother was when she started to exhibit symptoms of the disease, but she has yet to show any symptoms. Wexler is currently a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University in New York City.
