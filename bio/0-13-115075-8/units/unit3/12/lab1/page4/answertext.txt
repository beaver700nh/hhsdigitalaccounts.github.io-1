&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Colchicine is added to the cells to stop mitosis at metaphase when the chromosomes are fully condensed and easiest to observe. Then, the cells are placed in a hypotonic medium. This increases the volume of the cells and makes them swell. Next, the cells are dropped on a slide. This flattens the cells so that the chromosomes spread out. Finally, the chromosomes are stained to make them easier to see.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Using cytogenetic techniques, it is possible to discover abnormalities in chromosome structure, such as deletions, translocations, and inversions, as well as errors in chromosome number, such as trisomy 21.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> HeLa cells and other cancer cells may have extra chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or chromosomes that have pieces missing.
