&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Albinism must be recessive because neither of Danny's parents have albinism. If albinism were dominant, then one of the parents would have the trait. Both parents must be carriers so that each contributes one recessive allele to the affected offspring (Danny). 
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> If the mother has albinism, all of Danny's children will have the condition. If the mother is homozygous dominant (no albinism), none of the children will have the condition, but all will be carriers. If the mother is a carrier, then there is a 50 percent chance that each child could have albinism.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> At least one of the grandparents is a carrier (Aa); however, it's possible that both of them are carriers.
