&answer1= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> The only way would be to perform a testcross and cross that organism with one that has the recessive short horn trait (H- x hh). If any of the offspring have short horns, the organism is heterozygous.
&answer2= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> When a trait, such as tail shape, demonstrates intermediate inheritance, the appearance of the heterozygote is intermediate between the two homozygotes. Therefore, a tail that has one curl is intermediate between a tail with no curl and one that has two curls, and the one curl phenotype will be heterozygous (Tt).
