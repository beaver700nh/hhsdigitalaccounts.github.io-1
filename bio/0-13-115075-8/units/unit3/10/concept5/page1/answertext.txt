&answer1= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> The male fruit fly has the X and Y sex chromosomes. An eye color gene is found on the X chromosome but not on the Y chromosome. Therefore, in the male fruit fly, whatever allele is found on the X chromosome is expressed. In the F<font size="7">2</font>  generation, about half the males inherited the chromosome with the X<font size="7"> r</font> allele, and the rest inherited the chromosome with the X<font size="7">R</font> allele. The F<font size="7">2</font> females each have two X chromosomes. Since the male flies all have red-eyes, they donated only X<font size="7">R</font>  (red-eye allele) to all the females, and they must be red-eyed (either X<font size="7">R</font>X<font size="7">R</font> or X<font size="7">R</font>X<font size="7">r</font>).
&answer2= <b>The suggested answer is:</b> Yes, but it is rare. A cross could include a white-eyed male and either a white-eyed female or a female heterozygous for red eye.
&answer3= <b>The suggested answer is:</b>  White-eyed females could only happen when mutations occurred at the same location on both X chromosomes-an event less likely than the one mutation needed to produce a white-eyed male.
