&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The DNA of all organisms has the same genetic code. The basic process for transcribing and translating DNA and RNA is similar in all organisms.&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The <i>bla</i> gene causes bacteria to produce beta-lactamase, which provides resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. Bacterial cells that have taken in the pGLO plasmid have a copy of the <i>bla</i> gene and are resistant to ampicillin. If you try to grow the bacteria on agar plates containing ampicillin, only the cells carrying the plasmid will survive and grow into colonies.&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Yes, they will glow. Both the <i>bla</i> gene and the GFP gene are on every copy of the pGLO plasmid.
