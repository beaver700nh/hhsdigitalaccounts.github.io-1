            <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
            To start your investigation, you will take a closer look at how the nephron works. You will also see how filtration and reabsorption in the nephron can be affected by disorders such as diabetes or high blood pressure and kidney damage. In the lab, you will take on the role of a medical technologist and test simulated urine samples for the presence of sugar or protein.</p>
            
            <p><b>Background</b><br>
            Sugars such as glucose are not normally present in urine. Recall that during filtration in the kidneys, blood pressure forces water, dissolved sugars, and other substances through the walls of a ball of capillaries (the glomerulus). The fluid, called filtrate, collects in the nephron tubule. During reabsorption, the dissolved sugars (along with other substances) are normally reabsorbed from the tubule into the blood. However, if a person's blood sugar concentration is abnormally high, as occurs in the disease diabetes mellitus, some of the glucose is not reabsorbed. Instead, the excess glucose remains in the nephron tubule and eventually exits the body in urine. (People with diabetes mellitus have elevated blood glucose levels because they do not have enough insulin in their blood, or because their body cells do not respond to insulin. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that increases the amount of glucose that enters body cells.)</p> 

			<p>Similarly, when the kidneys are functioning well, little protein is present in urine. Most proteins are too large to leave the blood by passing through the walls of the glomerulus and so they never enter the nephron tubule. However, when a person has kidney damage or high blood pressure, proteins sometimes are forced from the blood into the tubule. These proteins are not reabsorbed and eventually exit the body in the urine. High blood pressure and abnormally high amounts of protein in the urine occur in a condition called preeclampsia (pree ih KLAMP see uh), which affects about 5 percent of women during middle to late pregnancy. When not treated promptly, preeclampsia can lead to seizures and other serious complications.</p>

			<p>Medical technologists routinely analyze urine samples from patients to help doctors diagnose certain diseases. In this procedure, called urinalysis, a urine sample is usually tested for the presence of sugar, protein, and other substances. In this investigation you will take on the role of a medical technician. First you will use Benedict's solution to test for glucose. Benedict's solution contains a copper compound that reacts with glucose. In the presence of glucose, Benedict's solution changes color from blue to dark red or orange. This reaction occurs best in hot water. Next, you will use Biuret reagent to test for protein. Biuret reagent contains molecules that react with the bonds between amino acids in proteins. When proteins are present, Biuret reagent changes color from light blue to deep blue or purple.</p>
            
            <p><b>Prelab Activity</b><br>
            To see how disorders such as diabetes and preeclampsia affect nephron function, follow the directions below. Then, answer the Prelab Questions.</p>
