&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The ribs are attached to the rib muscles that contract during inhalation and relax during exhalation. A broken rib would hinder this process and also make breathing quite painful.  
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The structure is ideal for gas exchange because alveoli have membranes that are just one cell layer thick, and they are surrounded by pulmonary capillaries. Oxygen and carbon dioxide pass easily between air and blood.   
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> During inhalation, the diaphragm and rib muscles contract, and the size of the chest cavity increases. Because the lungs attach tightly to the wall of the chest cavity, they are stretched and their volume increases. This action results in reduced air pressure within the alveoli.  Air then rushes in from the nose and mouth to fill the alveoli.
