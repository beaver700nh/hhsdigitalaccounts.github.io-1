&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The coronary arteries nourish the cardiac muscles cells by supplying oxygen and nutrients for cellular respiration.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> A normal coronary artery has an inner layer of epithelium, a middle layer of smooth muscle, and an outer layer of connective tissue all surrounding a generous pathway for blood flow. A blocked atherosclerotic artery has plaque build-up that narrows the artery pathway and restricts blood flow.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> A heart attack means that a portion of the heart has died due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. The remaining parts of the heart are still alive. If the heart is strong enough, it will continue beating, though the heart's rhythm is often disturbed.
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Atherosclerosis results from plaque build up inside the heart's artery wall, causing increasingly narrow openings. This can possibly lead to a heart attack. A diet that is high in fat and cholesterol causes plaque build up. To reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, it is recommended that people include fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in their diets, and avoid foods high in saturated animal fats.
