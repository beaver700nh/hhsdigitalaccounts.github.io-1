&answer1=<b>The correct answer is:</b> Capillary; the thin walls make possible the exchange by diffusion of nutrients, gases, and waste products between tissue cells and the blood. 
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The inner layer of smooth muscle is thicker in arteries than in veins. This muscle tissue allows an artery to constrict or dilate, regulating blood flow under pressure. 
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> <b>1) Right Atrium</b>: Oxygen-depleted blood returns to the heart from the veins and enters the right atrium. From the right atrium, blood passes through the right atrioventricular valve into the right ventricle. <b>2) Right Ventricle</b>:  The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary valve into the right and left pulmonary arteries, which lead to the lungs. <b>3) Left Atrium</b>:  Freshly oxygenated blood flows back from the lungs through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. From the left atrium, blood passes through the left atrioventricular valve into the left ventricle. <b>4) Left Ventricle</b>:  The left ventricle pumps blood through the aortic valve into the aorta. 
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Skeletal muscle contractions enhance the movement of blood through veins, and one-way valves prevent the backflow of blood.
