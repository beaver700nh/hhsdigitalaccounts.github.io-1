&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Systole refers to the contraction of the heart muscle, when the heart chambers actively pump blood. Diastole refers to the relaxation of heart muscle, when the chambers passively fill with blood. 
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> During the first phase, blood is forced into the ventricles, and the ventricles fill with blood from the atria. During the second phase, blood is forced from the ventricles into the outgoing arteries. The atria fill with blood from the body's incoming veins. During the last phase, the atria and ventricles fill with blood from the body's veins. This is a period of total heart relaxation.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The pacemaker sets the rate at which the heart contracts by initiating the heartbeat, on average every 0.80 seconds. Electrical impulses fired from the pacemaker cause the atria to contract. 
&answer4=<b>The correct answer is:</b> An ECG is a graphic record of the electrical activity of the heart.
