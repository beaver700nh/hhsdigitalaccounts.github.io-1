&answer2=<b>The correct answer is:</b> The chemicals are the neurotransmitters that are released from the knobs at the end of the axons. 
&answer3=<b>The correct answer is:</b> The neurotransmitters are stored in sac-like organelles called vesicles that are located in the knobs of the axon.  
&answer4=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The protein receptor has a unique binding site that allows only a specific neurotransmitter to bind to it. When it binds to the receptor, an action potential may fire and initiate a nerve signal.
