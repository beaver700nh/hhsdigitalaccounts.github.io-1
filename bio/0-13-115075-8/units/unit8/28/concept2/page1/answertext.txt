&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The dendrites and axon are both types of fibers that project from the neuron's cell body. Dendrites receive nerve signals and carry them toward the cell body; the axon conducts the nerve signal away from the cell body and toward other cells.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The Schwann cells produce large amounts of plasma membrane. This membrane forms layers that tightly wind around the axon. 
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> When a nerve impulse travels along an axon with a  myelin sheath, it jumps from node to node, at a faster rate than if it were traveling down an axon without a myelin sheath.
