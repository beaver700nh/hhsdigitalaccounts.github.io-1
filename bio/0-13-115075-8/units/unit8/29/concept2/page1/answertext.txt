&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> They are called accessory organs because they do not form part of the alimentary tube. Instead, they aid the organs of the alimentary canal in the digestive process in various ways.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The microvilli increase the surface area of the small intestine, which allows for greater absorption of the products of digestion.
&answer3=<b>The correct answer is:</b> From the mouth, food moves into the pharynx. The food, now called bolus, flows into the esophagus where a series of muscle contractions move it into the stomach. In the stomach, the partially digested bolus is turned into chyme, which flows into the small intestine, completing the digestion of food. Undigested food moves through the large intestine.
