&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The orchid has a strong fragrance that attracts male bees to land on it. Fragrant oils produced by the flower lure a bee onto a slippery surface above the "bucket." The bee falls into bucket, which contains fluid, and cannot climb out. Instead, the bee is forced to exit the flower through a tube containing the stigma and style where the bee then picks up and/or deposits pollen.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> The evening primrose would be likely to attract hummingbirds because they are attracted to red-colored, tubular-shaped flowers. The poppy would be likely to attract bees because they are attacted to yellow-colored, cup-shaped flowers.
&answer3=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> If hummingbirds spend more time at a flower, they are apt to pick up more pollen to distribute to other plants. If a bee must visit more than one flower to gather enough food, the bee is also apt to distribute more pollen to other plants.
