&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Changing the light period does not change the flowering response. Only when the dark period is changed (for example, by a light flash) does the flowering response change.
&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> At least two hours after darkness, you would have to expose the plants to a flash of light rich in the red wavelengths.
