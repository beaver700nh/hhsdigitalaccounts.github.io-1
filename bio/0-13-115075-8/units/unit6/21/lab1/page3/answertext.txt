&answer1=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> To measure the transpiration rate of a leaf, you use potometers placed in different conditions and test leaves in each set of conditions. You observe and record how long it takes water to leave the potometer and use the data to calculate transpiration rates for each leaf.&answer2=<b>The suggested answer is:</b> Due to osmosis, water follows potassium ions into guard cells. Water pressure causes the guard cells to swell until gaps (the stomata) open between the cells. When more water has been lost through transpiration than is replaced from the soil, the guard cells lose pressure and sag together, closing the stomata.
