              <b>Theodor Schwann<br>
              1810&#150;1882</b><br>
              <br>
              Theodor Schwann was born in Prussia, a country bordering Russia that eventually became Poland and Germany, in 1810. Schwann studied medicine and loved looking at materials through the microscope. He was aware of <a href="hooke.html" title="biography of Robert Hooke">Robert Hooke's</a> discovery of cell walls and Schleiden's (another pioneer of cell biology) hypothesis that cells are the basic building blocks of plants. Based on this information and his own observations, Schwann 
              published a research paper that included illustrations of the animal 
              material that he observed. While he acknowledged that plant cells 
              and the structures that he was studying looked very different, he 
              suggested that animals were made of cells as well. Schwann based 
              this hypothesis on his observations that all cells, both plant and 
              animal, regardless of their size and shape, contained a nucleus. 
            </p>
            <p>Schwann studied medicine and became particularly interested in the way the body functions. While studying the process of digestion, he discovered the stomach enzyme, pepsin. </p>
            <p>As a professor of physiology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, Schwann studied yeast cells and their role in the chemical process 
              of fermentation. He concluded that yeast cells produce alcohol as 
              part of their cell processes. He later studied the muscle and nerve cells of animals and discovered cells that form a protective layer 
              around the nerve axon. These cells, now called <i>Schwann cells</i>, were 
              named after Theodor Schwann, the first person to observe them.<br>
