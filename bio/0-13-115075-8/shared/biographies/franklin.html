              <b>Rosalind Elsie Franklin<br>
              1920&#150;1958</b><br>
              <br>
              Rosalind Franklin was born on July 25, 1920, into a well-educated, 
              wealthy family in London. She attended St. Paul's Girls' School&#151;one 
              of the few schools in London where girls could learn physics and 
              chemistry. By the age of 15, she'd decided to become a scientist. 
              Her decision caused an uproar in her family: her father did not 
              approve of higher education for women. Franklin's aunt and mother 
              took her side, and eventually her father relented. In 1938, Franklin 
              enrolled at the University of Cambridge.</p>
            <p>When Franklin graduated, she received a fellowship, but she gave 
              it up to help the war effort by studying carbon and searching for 
              more efficient ways to get fuel from coal. After the war, she continued 
              her research and earned a Ph.D. in physical chemistry. She moved to 
              Paris, where she lived in a tiny, single-room apartment&#151;a far 
              cry from the luxury she'd grown up with. Franklin worked at 
              a laboratory where she learned to use X-ray diffraction techniques 
              in her ongoing study of the structure of carbon.</p>
            <p>In 1951, Franklin returned to London to join a group of scientists 
              who were trying to determine the structure of DNA. From the moment 
              she arrived, Franklin, as a woman, was treated as an outsider. She 
              wasn't even allowed to eat in the same dining hall as her co-workers! 
              There were more serious problems, as well. One of the other scientists, 
              Maurice Wilkins, happened to be on vacation when Franklin joined 
              the group. When he returned, he misunderstood her position: he thought 
              she was supposed to be a technical assistant, when in fact she was 
              leading her own research group on a project that was just as important 
              as his own.</p>
            <p>Despite the less-than-welcoming reception, Franklin set to work. 
              She managed to extract DNA fibers that were finer than any that 
              other researchers had obtained, and she arranged them in parallel 
              bundles. Carefully, methodically, she documented and analyzed her 
              data. She was the first scientist to realize that the sugar and 
              phosphate chains in DNA were located outside the molecule. Using 
              a technique that she invented, she found a way to photograph the 
              DNA molecule using X-ray crystallography.</p>
            <p>Franklin was on the verge of unraveling the secret of the DNA molecule, 
              but she couldn't quite figure out how to put it all together. Then, 
              without her knowledge or permission, Maurice Wilkins&#151;the co-worker 
              from her lab&#151;showed Franklin's data and photographs to two of her 
              rivals, <a href="watson.html" title="biography of James Watson">James Watson</a> and Francis Crick. 
              When Watson saw Franklin's work, everything became clear to him. 
              In 1953, Watson and Crick published an article explaining the double-helix 
              structure of the DNA molecule. Franklin&#151;who still didn't realize 
              that Watson and Crick had used her research&#151;published another article 
              to support their work.</p>
            <p>After the publication of Watson and Crick's article, Franklin 
              turned her attention to studying viruses, especially the tobacco 
              mosaic virus and the polio virus. She died on April 16, 1958, of 
              ovarian cancer, at the age of 37.<br>
