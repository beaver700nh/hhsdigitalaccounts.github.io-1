They certainly were not expected to study microorganisms or beetle larvae! Nettie Stevens, however, was one woman who broke the mold. Born in Vermont in 1861, Stevens eventually became a librarian. At age 35, she decided that she wanted to get more education, and, using the money she had saved from her job as a librarian, she enrolled at Stanford University to study biology. Later, she earned a Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College. <br><br>Stevens became intrigued with microscopic marine life and made detailed notes and drawings of new species of marine organisms. This attention to detail would be a benefit in her later research. She traveled to Europe and worked with Theodor Boveri, a physician who specialized in cell research  at the Zoological Institute in Germany. Stevens and Boveri studied chromosomes and their role in heredity. She then went to Carnegie Institute in Pennsylvania, where she made history. <br><br> At the beginning of the 1900s, scientists were still arguing whether gender was inherited or was caused by the embryo's environment. Curious about the answer, Stevens studied the chromosomes of the mealworm larva (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>). By examining the chromosomes of the body cells of male and female larvae, she found that males had 19 1/2 chromosomes while females had 20. She called the male half-chromosome <i>Y</i> and named its female counterpart <i>X</i>. She then studied the egg and sperm cells (gametes), which have half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. She discovered that the egg contained 10 full&#150;sized chromosomes, including the X chromosome, while the sperm could contain either 10 full-sized chromosomes (including an X) or 9 1/2 (including an Y). Upon further study, Stevens found that when fertilization occurred with a sperm containing an X chromosome, the offspring was female. When fertilization occurred with a sperm containing a Y chromosome, the offspring was male. Stevens determined that the half-chromosome, the Y, determined maleness; while two X chromosomes meant the organism was a female.  She published her results in 1905, but they were not accepted by the scientific community until Edmund Wilson, a male New York biologist, made the same discovery later in the year.<br><br>Stevens continued her work studying the role of sex chromosomes and eventually determined that many other organisms also have X and Y chromosomes that determine gender. She also discovered that chromosomes exist in pairs. In 1944, she was elected to the U.S. National Women's Hall of Fame. <br><br></p></span>													</td>				</tr>				</table>							</TD>		</TR>	</TABLE>				<table WIDTH="500" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">		<tr VALIGN="TOP"> 			<td><IMG SRC="../../images/bottom_line.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="2" alt="bottom line"></TD>		</TR>	</table>	<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">writeCopyright();</script>		</BODY></HTML>
