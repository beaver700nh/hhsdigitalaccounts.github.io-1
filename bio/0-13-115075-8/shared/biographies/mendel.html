              <b>Johann Gregor Mendel<br>
              1822-1884</b><br>
              <br>
              Born on July 22, 1822, Gregor Mendel was an active member of the 
              scientific community of his day. Educated at the University of Vienna, 
              he decided at the age of 21 to become a friar at an Augustinian 
              monastery in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The monastery was a center of 
              contemporary learning in theology, philosophy, and the natural sciences, 
              and Mendel was able to exchange ideas with other scientific thinkers.</p>
            <p>In the early 1850s, Mendel wanted to develop some new color variations 
              for the flowers in the monastery gardens. He began experimenting 
              with the pea plants in the garden. At that time, nobody understood 
              how traits are inherited. Mendel took a unique approach: he studied 
              just one trait at a time. For example, he might cross two plants 
              that were exactly the same, except that one was tall and one was 
              short. . . or one was yellow and the other green. . . or one had peas that 
              were round and the other peas that were wrinkled. He found that 
              the pea plants' offspring inherited the various traits in constant 
              proportions. He realized that inheritance is governed by mathematical 
              principles that he could use to predict what kind of offspring the 
              plants would produce.</p>
            <p>Mendel developed a hypothesis to explain what he saw. He proposed 
              that traits were transferred through reproductive cells according 
              to certain principles. He would later test his hypothesis in a total 
              of 27 species of plants.</p>
            <p>Mendel published his findings in 1865 in <i>The Proceedings of 
              the Br&uuml;nn Natural Science Society</i>. The paper was widely distributed 
              to scientific associations and libraries, and Mendel himself sent 
              copies to prominent botanists, but few people took notice. At that 
              time, the scientific community was up in arms over <!--<a href="darwin.html">-->Charles Darwin's<!--</a>--> 
              theory of evolution, and Mendel's discovery was more or less eclipsed. 
              Although a few botanists quoted his work as early as 1867, it wasn't 
              until 1900 that scientists would rediscover and embrace Mendel's 
              Laws of Heredity.</p>
            <p>In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery, a position he held 
              until his death in 1884. During this time he also began studying 
              inheritance in bees. Eventually, scientists determined that his 
              principles could be applied to all sexually-reproducing organisms.</p>
            <p>Today, visitors to the city of Brno (now a part of the Czech Republic) 
              can visit Mendel's tomb in the central cemetery and "Mendelianum," 
              a museum located in the Augustinian monastery where Mendel lived 
              and worked.<br>
