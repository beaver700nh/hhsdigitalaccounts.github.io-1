					<b>Galen<br>
					c. 129&#150;c. 201</b><br><br>
				
					Galen came from a wealthy family in Pergamon, an ancient city in Greece. Until the age of 14, he was taught by his father, an architect and builder who also loved mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and literature. Galen wrote his first book&#151;a commentary on the works of a then-popular philosopher&#151;when he was only 13 years old.<br><br>  

As a teenager, Galen became an attendant in the temple of Asclepius, the mythological Greek god of healing. Galen often listened to the conversations of renowned physicians who gathered at the temple. He noted that many of these men gave lectures on the human body, although they had no experience examining the human body. Galen thought that physicians needed to base their ideas on actual experience and observations. He began conducting systematic anatomical experiments to learn about the body.<br><br>  

When Galen was approximately 19 years old, his father died. Galen traveled to Smyrna, Corinth, and Alexandria to continue his medical studies. After returning to Pergamon several years later, he was named physician to fighters known as gladiators&#151;a position that gave him ample opportunity to study the human body, since gladiators suffered many wounds. After a few years, however, he sought a wider arena for his talents: Rome. <br><br>

Galen quickly became a well-known figure in the capital of the Roman Empire, and in time he was appointed physician to the Roman Emperor and his son. He performed countless dissections to learn about the connection between the nervous system and muscular system. He discovered the functions of the kidneys and bladder, and he showed that the brain controls the voice. He also described the valves of the heart, noted structural differences between arteries and veins, and was the first to show that arteries carry blood (earlier physicians thought that arteries carried air). Not all of Galen's observations were correct. For example, he thought that the liver was the central organ of the vascular system (we now know that the heart is), and he thought that when blood reached the outer parts of the body it turned into skin.<br><br> 

Galen stayed in Rome until his death, conducting research and doing a lot of writing. He kept a full staff of scribes who recorded everything he said, ensuring that his findings would be preserved for future generations.  Unfortunately, the temple where he stored his work was damaged in a fire and much of his work was lost. Even so, Galen's surviving works make up more than half of the writings on medicine that have survived from ancient times, and his theories dominated medical practice for nearly 1,500 years. <br><br></p>
