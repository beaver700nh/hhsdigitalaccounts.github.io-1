A chemist by trade, Perkin was trying to make an artificial form of quinine. Quinine, the only known treatment for malaria, is obtained only from the bark of the cinchona tree, grown in Java. Therefore, it was very scarce. During his pursuit of synthetic quinine, Perkin concocted a purple gooey substance from coal tar. He realized the substance's possible usefulness to the fashion industry when he accidentally spilled some on his shirt and stained it purple!<br><br>Prior to this discovery, colored fabrics were created using natural dyes from roots, leaves, and flowers. Some insects also produced vibrant colors. Purple was a difficult color to dye. A snail, called the Murex snail, was the main source for this color. These snails, found in the Mediterranean Sea, were difficult to obtain. With his discovery of synthetic purple dye, Perkin changed the fashion world. Soon mauve, a shade of purple, (or <i>mauveine</i>, as he called it) became the color of choice for common people as well as for royalty. Perkin built a chemical factory and produced large quantities of mauveine and other colors, as well.<br><br> Perkin had no idea that his mauveine dye would also have an impact on the scientific world. In 1882, a scientist named <a href="flemming.html" title="biography of Walther Flemming">Walther Flemming</a> used Perkin's dye to stain some cells, which he then observed under a microscope. The stain made it possible for him to see a tangle of threads in the nucleus. He called these threads <i>chromatin</i>, meaning "color." Later, while observing cells undergoing cell division, Flemming could see individual chromosomes. The discovery that dyes could be used to see parts of the cell led to the development of a variety of dyes that would be important in identifying cell organelles and even in locating genes. <br><br></p>							</span>																</td>						</tr>					</table>							</TD>		</TR>	</TABLE>				<table WIDTH="500" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">			<tr VALIGN="TOP"> 				<td>				<IMG SRC="../../images/bottom_line.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="2" alt="bottom line">				</TD>			</TR>	</table>		<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">writeCopyright();</script>		</BODY></HTML>
