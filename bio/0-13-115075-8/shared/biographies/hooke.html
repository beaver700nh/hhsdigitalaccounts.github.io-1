              <b>Robert Hooke<br>
              1635&#150;1703</b><br>
              <br>
              Not only was Robert Hooke a pioneer in microbiology, but he was 
              also a successful inventor, physicist, astronomer, and architect. 
              Born in 1635 on the Isle of Wight (an island off the southern coast 
              of Great Britain), Hooke barely survived his childhood years. He 
              battled smallpox, sleeping disorders, headaches, dizzy spells, and 
              digestive problems&#151;for years, the only food his body could 
              tolerate was milk. Since he was too weak to go to school, he spent 
              a lot of time figuring things out on his own. His ability to invent 
              things was clear even when he was just a child. For example, he 
              built mechanical toys that actually worked, including a model warship 
              with guns that fired.</p>
            <p>In 1665, at the age of 30, he published <i>Micrographia</i>, 
              an illustrated book showing things he'd seen under his hand-built 
              microscope&#151;including structures that looked like empty boxes, 
              which he noticed while examining thin slices of cork. Since these 
              box-like structures reminded Hooke of monks' cells in a monastery, 
              he called them "cells." In fact, what he had observed were cell 
              walls. Hooke's observation paved the way for scientists' current 
              understanding of cells as the building blocks of all living things.</p>
            <p>Hooke also built the first Gregorian reflecting telescope, which 
              uses mirrors to help magnify images, and made other contributions 
              to the study of astronomy. For instance, he tried to prove that 
              the Earth rotates around the sun in an elliptical pattern in part 
              because of the sun's gravitational pull. Since he couldn't 
              prove his theory mathematically, however, credit for the theory 
              of gravity went to Sir Isaac Newton, who proved it a few years later.</p>
            <p>Hooke is also remembered for the buildings he designed, many of 
              which still stand in London today. When much of London was destroyed 
              in the Great Fire of 1666, Hooke built a model to show how the city 
              could be rebuilt and served as chief assistant to Christopher Wren, 
              the architect responsible for rebuilding the city.<br>
