					<b>Philip D. Gingerich<br>
					1946&#150;Present</b><br><br>
					
					Philip Gingerich is intrigued by the information trapped for millions of years in the fossil record&#151;secrets about how mammals like primates and whales first originated, and how they've changed over time.<br><br> 

Before venturing out into the field, Gingerich completed many years of higher education at some very notable institutions. He earned his undergraduate degree at Princeton University, then went on to earn a master's and doctorate degree in geology at Yale. After receiving his Ph.D., he continued his studies at the Université de Montpellier in France under a special fellowship.<br><br>

Gingerich not only is interested in what the fossil record can reveal about evolutionary changes, but also in the correlation between those changes as well as the various small-scale changes that can be seen over just a few generations. Over the course of his career, Gingerich's fieldwork has taken him to such places as Egypt, Pakistan, Jordan, Tunisia, and Wyoming. He has uncovered a number of startling finds&#151;including the fossil remains of an ancestor to modern whales.<br><br> 

Gingerich is a professor of paleontology at the University of Michigan, where he teaches students about vertebrate paleontology and mammalian evolution. He also is an editor of several scientific journals in his field, including the <i>American Journal of Science</i> and the <i>Journal of Mammalian Evolution</i>.
