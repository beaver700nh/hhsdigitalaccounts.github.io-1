              <b>J. Craig Venter<br>
              1946&#150;Present</b><br><br>
              John Craig Venter didn't get off to an especially promising start&#151;at least, not in high school. As a matter of fact, he barely graduated. He was much happier surfing the California waves than studying.</p>

            <p>He finished school during the Vietnam War, and soon afterward he was drafted by the navy. The navy trained him as a medical corpsman and sent him to the Da Nang hospital, where he got a brutal introduction to the world of medicine. When he got out of the navy, he went to the University of California, San Diego, to study to become a doctor. </p>

            <p>He found that he was more interested in science than in medicine. Six years later, he left the university with a Ph.D. in physiology and pharmacology. In 1984, he went to work for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where he became section chief and lab chief at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. His job was to try to identify&#151;and decode&#151;the gene responsible for producing a protein found in brain cells.</p>
            
            <p>It was a tedious task&#151;that is, until Venter heard about a new machine that used lasers to do the decoding. Using his own money (NIH wouldn't approve the expense), he bought one of the machines. With it, he was able to develop an entirely new way to identify genes. His technique, which came to be known as the expressed sequence tags (EST) method, was to skip over the "junk DNA"&#151;the 95 percent of human DNA that doesn't seem to serve any role in protein production&#151;and focus on only the sequences that encode proteins. This method was faster and cheaper than the methods being used by other researchers. </p>

            <p>In 1992, Venter and his wife, Claire Fraser, left NIH and founded a private, nonprofit research organization, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). Venter continued using his EST method to decode genes, but now he wanted to go one step further: he wanted to sequence an entire genome. He decided to tackle <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, a bacteria that causes infections. He planned to use a method known as shotgun sequencing. First he would break apart the DNA into millions of segments. Next, he would sequence each individual piece. Finally, he would put them all back together again in the right order. He applied for a grant from NIH, but too impatient to wait for a response, he started the project on his own. By the time NIH let him know that his application was rejected, he had nearly completed the project!</p>

            <p>Once that project was complete&#151;making the <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> the first free-living organism to have its entire genome sequenced&#151;Venter moved on to sequence the human genome. In May 1998, he left TIGR (although he still serves as chairman of the board, and his wife, Claire, is still president and director) to start another new company. . . this time, for profit. He shocked researchers at the Human Genome Project when he announced that his new company, Celera Genomics, would sequence the entire human genome by 2001. HGP researchers had been working on the human genome since 1990, and they weren't even close to finishing. And Venter thought he could do the job in three years!</p>

            <p>But he did. Using high-tech machines and an enormously powerful computer&#151;and using information made available by the HGP researchers&#151;he and his staff completed the task. On June 26, 2000, Venter joined the head of the HGP and President Bill Clinton at the White House to announce that 90 percent of the human genome had been successfully sequenced. <i>TIME</i> magazine named Venter Scientist of the Year in 2000, and in February 2001, <i>Science</i> magazine published the details of the project. In January 2002, Venter resigned as president of Celera, but he remained affiliated with the company as chairman of Celera's scientific advisory board. Venter is currently active in several projects, including the study of social issues related to genetic research.<br><br>
