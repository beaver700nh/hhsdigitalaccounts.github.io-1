Their muscles moved uncontrollably, and they had frequent mental lapses. All three were eventually diagnosed with Huntington's disease, an inherited disease that usually appears when people are in their forties or fifties.<br><br>Wexler learned that her mother also had a 50 percent chance of having the disease. Wexler watched helplessly as her mother developed the symptoms of Huntington's disease, robbing her of mental capability and muscle control. When her mother finally died, Wexler decided that she would spend her life working to find the cause and cure of this disease, which affects 1 in every 20,000 people. She went to college and graduate school, studying neuropsychology. In 1969, she became president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which studies the causes of inherited diseases. <br><br> In 1979, Wexler learned about a village in Venezuela that had an unusually high percentage of people with Huntington's disease. These people were all part of a very large family, which could be traced back to one woman who lived in the early 1800s. Wexler and her colleagues went to this village, San Luis, many times during the 1980s to collect blood and create a chart called a pedigree. There are now more than 15,000 people entered into <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/genetictrail/b100.html" title="Launches external Web site">this pedigree</a>, making it the largest known pedigree in the world. <i>(Scroll down the Web site's page to view a photo of Nancy and the pedigree.)</i><br><br>As a result of years of analysis, scientists were able to determine that the gene for Huntington's disease resides on the tip of chromosome 4. Because of this, geneticists can now determine if someone may develop the disease in the future by examining the chromosomes in that person's body cells. <br><br>Although this technology is in place, Wexler and her sister have decided not to be tested to see if they have the gene. Wexler is now the age that her mother was when she started to exhibit symptoms of the disease, but she does not show any symptoms. Wexler is currently a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University in New York City.<br><br></p></span>												</td>				</tr>				</table>							</TD>		</TR>	</TABLE>		<table WIDTH="500" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">		<tr VALIGN="TOP"> 			<td><br><IMG SRC="../../images/bottom_line.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="2" alt="bottom line"></TD>		</TR>	</table>	<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">writeCopyright();</script>		</BODY></HTML>
